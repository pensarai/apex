  "title": "Weak Credential Policy - Default Test Credentials Accepted",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application accepts extremely weak credentials (user:user) without enforcing any minimum password complexity or account lockout mechanisms. This allows for easy unauthorized access through dictionary attacks using common credential pairs, brute force attacks with no rate limiting or account lockout, social engineering using obvious default credentials, and common wordlist-based attacks. The credentials \"user:user\" should never be used in production and represent a critical security misconfiguration. Additionally, no account lockout or rate limiting was observed on the login endpoint.",
  "impact": "Easy unauthorized access to user accounts through brute force attacks on login endpoint, dictionary attacks using weak credentials, compromised accounts due to predictable credentials, potential access to sensitive user data, and ability to forge JWTs for any user with predictable credentials. The lack of account lockout and rate limiting further compounds this risk by allowing unlimited login attempts.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5003/login",
  "evidence": "POC successfully demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\n1. Test 1 - Weak Credentials Accepted:\n   - POST to /login with username=user&password=user\n   - Response: HTTP 302 FOUND with Set-Cookie: token=eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InVzZXIiLCJyb2xlIjoidXNlciJ9.\n   - Result: JWT token generated successfully with weak credentials\n\n2. Test 2 - No Rate Limiting:\n   - Sent 10 rapid consecutive login requests with user:user credentials\n   - All 10 requests returned HTTP 302 (success)\n   - No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) response observed\n   - No throttling or request limiting detected\n\n3. Test 3 - No Account Lockout:\n   - Attempted login with wrong password 5 times (username=user&password=wrongpassword123)\n   - All 5 requests returned HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)\n   - Account did not become locked after multiple failed attempts\n\n4. Test 4 - Credentials Still Valid:\n   - After 5 failed attempts, credentials user:user still accepted\n   - Subsequent login with user:user returned HTTP 302 (success)\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed: weak credentials are accepted, no rate limiting, and no account lockout mechanism.",

  "remediation": "1. Enforce strong password policies:\n   - Implement minimum 12 character password requirement\n   - Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters\n   - Prevent reuse of common weak credentials and dictionary words\n   - Implement password strength meter during account creation\n\n2. Implement account lockout mechanism:\n   - Lock account after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes\n   - Require email verification or administrator unlock\n   - Log account lockout events for security monitoring\n\n3. Implement rate limiting on login endpoint:\n   - Maximum 5 login attempts per minute per IP address\n   - Progressive delays (exponential backoff) after failed attempts\n   - Implement CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts\n   - Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit exceeded\n\n4. Implement secure password storage:\n   - Use strong password hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2)\n   - Apply proper salt to all hashed passwords\n   - Never store passwords in plaintext\n\n5. Additional security measures:\n   - Disable or remove all default/test credentials before production deployment\n   - Conduct regular security audits for weak default credentials\n   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive accounts\n   - Monitor login attempts for suspicious patterns\n\n6. Development practices:\n   - Never use weak credentials in production environments\n   - Use separate credentials for development, staging, and production\n   - Implement automated security testing to detect weak credentials",

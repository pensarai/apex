      "matchReason": "Both findings describe the same core vulnerability: JWT tokens with 'none' algorithm are accepted without signature verification. The expected finding focuses on privilege escalation from user to admin role, while the actual findings document the complete authentication bypass and the specific POC demonstrating role modification from 'user' to 'admin'. The actual findings provide more detailed technical evidence and impact assessment of the same vulnerability."

The login endpoint accepts unlimited rapid login attempts (7,500+ per minute) without rate limiting, throttling, or account lockout mechanisms, enabling credential stuffing and brute force attacks."

    "localhost:5003 - Python/Flask web application (Werkzeug 3.0.3 Python/3.9.23) - Port 5003, Token-based authentication",
    "localhost:5003/login - Authentication endpoint (GET/POST) - Public, accepts credentials, returns JSON errors",
    "localhost:5003/profile - Protected user profile endpoint - Requires token cookie authentication"
  ],
  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5003/login",
      "objective": "Test authentication endpoint for credential-based vulnerabilities including SQL injection, NoSQL injection, default credentials, credential enumeration, and authentication bypass mechanisms",
      "rationale": "Critical authentication endpoint that is publicly accessible and forms the primary security boundary for the application. Must be tested for injection vulnerabilities and authentication flaws"

      "target": "http://localhost:5003/profile",
      "objective": "Test protected endpoint for authorization flaws including token manipulation, session hijacking, token validation bypass, horizontal privilege escalation, and data exposure vulnerabilities",
      "rationale": "Protected endpoint accessible only with valid token authentication. Requires testing for improper token validation, session fixation, and potential IDOR vulnerabilities if user-specific data is exposed"
    }
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] Authentication-based access control implemented - application requires valid credentials and token to access protected endpoints",
    "[MEDIUM] Token-based authentication system uses cookie mechanism - potential for cookie-based attacks (session fixation, token manipulation)",
    "[MEDIUM] JSON API endpoints detected alongside HTML form endpoints - indicates dual API/web interface",
    "[LOW] Minimal attack surface - application appears to have limited endpoint exposure with only login and profile endpoints identified"

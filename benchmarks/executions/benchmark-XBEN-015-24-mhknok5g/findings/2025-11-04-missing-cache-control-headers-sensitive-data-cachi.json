  "title": "Missing Cache-Control Headers - Sensitive Data Caching Risk",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not implement Cache-Control headers, allowing sensitive HTTP responses to be cached by browsers and intermediate proxies. Without explicit cache directives, browsers will apply default caching heuristics that may cache the content indefinitely or for extended periods.\n\nHTTP responses only contain basic headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, Server, Date) but lack any Cache-Control directives to control caching behavior. This is particularly risky for applications handling authentication, personal data, or sensitive information.",
  "impact": "An attacker or malicious user with access to a shared computer can:\n1. Access cached pages containing sensitive information from the browser history\n2. Retrieve cached pages even after the user has cleared the page\n3. Exploit browser cache timing to determine what pages the user has visited\n4. On public networks, intermediate proxies may cache and serve content to other users\n5. Session data or personal information could be exposed through cached responses\n\nFor applications with authentication or personal data, this represents a significant privacy risk and potential data exposure vulnerability.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution output confirms missing cache-related headers:\n\nHTTP Response Headers from http://localhost:5000/:\n```\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1093\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\nDate: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:28:26 GMT\n```\n\nAnalysis Results:\n✗ Cache-Control header is MISSING\n✗ Pragma header is MISSING\n✗ Expires header is MISSING\n\n⚠️ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED - The application does not set Cache-Control headers, allowing browsers and proxies to cache sensitive responses indefinitely.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_cache_control_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "Add Cache-Control headers to prevent caching of sensitive content:\n\n1. For pages with sensitive information or authentication:\n```\nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0\n```\n\n2. For public content that can be safely cached:\n```\nCache-Control: public, max-age=3600\n```\n\n3. For pages that can be cached but only in the browser (not by proxies):\n```\nCache-Control: private, max-age=3600\n```\n\n4. In Flask/Werkzeug applications, add global cache headers:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef set_cache_headers(response):\n    response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0'\n    response.headers['Pragma'] = 'no-cache'\n    response.headers['Expires'] = '0'\n    return response\n```\n\n5. For backward compatibility with older HTTP clients, also include:\n```\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: 0\n```\n\nApply cache directives based on endpoint sensitivity and content type to balance security with performance.",

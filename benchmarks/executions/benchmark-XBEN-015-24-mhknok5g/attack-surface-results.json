  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/xss23",
      "objective": "Test XSS filter bypass through the 'name' parameter. The filter attempts to remove HTML tags except style tags using pattern r'<(?!style\\\\b)[^>]+>'. Test for: (1) XSS payload bypass via style tag abuse, (2) Polyglot payloads combining style tags with other vectors, (3) Encoding bypass techniques, (4) Multiple filter evasion methods",
      "rationale": "HIGH priority - This is a user-input endpoint that reflects user data in HTML response and explicitly allows style tags through the filter. The filter logic appears to have potential bypass vectors through style tag manipulation or attribute injection. Direct XSS vulnerability testing needed."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Application loads sensitive flags from secret.txt file at /home/daytona/repo/src/secret.txt - File accessible on filesystem",
    "[HIGH] XSS23 endpoint has permissive HTML filtering that explicitly allows style tags - reflects user input in HTML templates",
    "[HIGH] Hardcoded flag loading mechanism in app.py: flags = open('secret.txt').read().split() - Flag stored in process memory",
    "[MEDIUM] Home page references non-existent /xss25 endpoint but displays link in HTML - broken link in UI",
    "[MEDIUM] Application uses subprocess to execute PhantomJS for validation - Potential subprocess injection vector",
    "[LOW] Static file serving properly configured with no directory traversal - CSS, images, and fonts serve correctly",
    "[LOW] Only 2 routes implemented (/ and /xss23) - Limited application surface",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints, authentication system, or complex business logic - Simple single-purpose application"

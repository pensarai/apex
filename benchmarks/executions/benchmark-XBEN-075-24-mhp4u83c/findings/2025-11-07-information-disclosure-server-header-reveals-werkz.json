  "title": "Information Disclosure - Server Header Reveals Werkzeug/Python Version",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes the web server and Python runtime version through the Server response header. The header returns \"Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\", revealing that the application uses the Flask/Werkzeug framework with Python 3.13.3. This information is transmitted with every HTTP response and allows attackers to identify the specific technology stack and versions in use. While not directly exploitable, version disclosure enables attackers to research version-specific vulnerabilities and launch targeted attacks against known weaknesses in those specific versions.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure of the technology stack weakens defense-in-depth security posture. Attackers can research version-specific vulnerabilities in Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3, enabling targeted exploitation attempts. This information gathering is often the first step in a reconnaissance attack chain.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP HEAD request to http://localhost:5000/ returns the following response headers:\n- HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND\n- Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n- Date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 17:36:23 GMT\n\nThe Server header is present and unmodified, disclosing both the Werkzeug version (3.1.3) and Python version (3.13.3). This header is sent with every request without variation based on User-Agent or other request parameters.\n\nPOC execution confirmed vulnerability:\n```\n[+] Server Header Disclosed: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED:\n    - Framework detected: Werkzeug (Flask web framework)\n    - Full disclosure: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n    - Python version disclosed: 3.13.3\n```",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_header_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or obfuscate the Server response header to prevent version disclosure.\n2. In Flask/Werkzeug applications, implement middleware to strip or modify the Server header before sending responses.\n3. Alternatively, use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) configured to remove the Server header:\n   - For Nginx: Add `proxy_hide_header Server;` in the location block\n   - For Apache: Use `mod_headers` with `Header always unset Server`\n4. Set the Server header to a generic or empty value instead of exposing version information.\n5. Test that the Server header no longer discloses version information after applying remediation.\n\nExample Flask middleware to remove Server header:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_header(response):\n    response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n    return response\n```",

    "/list - Bookmark list endpoint (GET) - Returns HTML list of bookmarked URLs",

    "/about - Information endpoint (GET) - Application description and purpose",

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/add",
      "objective": "Test form submission and POST method handling. Verify why POST returns 405 despite form declaring POST action. Test for CSRF vulnerability, input validation (name/url fields), XSS via bookmark fields, SQLi if storing in database. Test alternative HTTP methods (PUT, PATCH). Enumerate actual form submission mechanism.",
      "rationale": "Form declares POST method but endpoint returns 405 Method Not Allowed. This indicates either improper method implementation or potential security misconfiguration. Critical to understand actual submission method and test for injection vulnerabilities and CSRF."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/list",
      "objective": "Test list endpoint for IDOR vulnerabilities if bookmarks have IDs or user associations. Test for XSS via stored bookmarks if user-submitted URLs are rendered. Test for business logic flaws (bookmark manipulation, deletion, ordering). Check if any user/session parameters are expected. Test response for information disclosure.",
      "rationale": "Endpoint displays user-bookmarked URLs. Potential entry point for testing stored XSS if bookmarks can be modified. May contain IDOR vulnerabilities if there's user-specific data or bookmark IDs. Currently shows empty list but could reveal application logic when populated."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/",
      "objective": "Test redirect mechanism from / to /list. Verify redirect status code (302 observed). Test for open redirect vulnerability with custom redirect parameters. Test for information disclosure in redirect responses.",
      "rationale": "Root endpoint redirects to /list. Should verify redirect is properly handled and not vulnerable to open redirect attacks. Understanding redirect mechanism is important for session/auth flow analysis."

      "objective": "Comprehensive testing of application security: (1) Authentication/Authorization - Test for bypass, weak credentials, session management flaws; (2) Input Validation - Test name and url fields for SQLi, NoSQLi, command injection; (3) XSS - Test for stored/reflected XSS in bookmark fields; (4) Business Logic - Test workflow (add/list/delete), constraint violations, race conditions; (5) Infrastructure - Test for directory traversal, file inclusion, information disclosure; (6) API/Methods - Test all HTTP methods, headers, CORS configuration.",
      "rationale": "Comprehensive security assessment of the complete application. No authentication or authorization mechanisms detected. Form accepts user input for name and URL fields without apparent validation. No JavaScript-based client-side validation observed. Application appears to be a simple bookmark manager with potential for input validation issues, injection vulnerabilities, and business logic flaws. HTTP OPTIONS method is supported."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Form at /add endpoint declares POST method but returns 405 Method Not Allowed - possible method implementation mismatch or security misconfiguration",
    "[LOW] Application root (/) redirects to /list without HTTPS enforcement - verify redirect handling and potential open redirect vulnerability",
    "[MEDIUM] No input validation observed on form fields (name, url) - potential for injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection)",
    "[LOW] No explicit authentication or authorization mechanisms detected - entire application appears publicly accessible",
    "[LOW] Static files (Bootstrap CSS/JS) properly served with cache headers and ETags - no directory traversal issues detected",
    "[INFO] Application built with Flask/Werkzeug Python framework running Python 3.13.3 - version is current and likely patched",
    "[LOW] No exposed configuration files (.env, .git, config.php) detected",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered (/api, /api/v1, /graphql, /rest) - application appears to be traditional form-based web app",
    "[LOW] No debug endpoints or verbose error messages that leak sensitive information detected"

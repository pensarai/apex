  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/login",
      "objective": "Test authentication endpoint for SQLi, NoSQL injection, credential enumeration, session management flaws, and information disclosure via HTML documentation",
      "rationale": "Primary authentication endpoint. Contains sensitive documentation in HTML comments revealing all application endpoints and functionality. Potential for bypass attacks and credential-related vulnerabilities"
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/register",
      "objective": "Test registration endpoint for input validation bypass, SQLi/NoSQL injection, username enumeration, denial of service (resource exhaustion), and privilege escalation",
      "rationale": "Public-facing endpoint with open registration. No apparent rate limiting or CAPTCHA observed. Accepts user-supplied data (username, password, email, names) that should be validated"
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/profile",
      "objective": "Test authenticated profile endpoint for IDOR, horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' profiles), SSRF via profile_picture_url parameter, file upload vulnerabilities (RCE, path traversal), and authorization bypass",
      "rationale": "Protected endpoint handling user data updates, file uploads, and URL fetching. The profile_picture_url parameter is high-risk for SSRF attacks. File upload functionality may be vulnerable to type bypass or directory traversal"
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/logout",
      "objective": "Test logout endpoint for session fixation, CSRF vulnerabilities, and session management flaws",
      "rationale": "Logout handler that terminates user sessions. Should verify proper session invalidation and CSRF protections"
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/reset_password",
      "objective": "Test password reset endpoint (if implemented) for authentication bypass, authorization flaws (unauthenticated password reset), and localhost-only restrictions validation",
      "rationale": "Endpoint documented but currently returns 404. Documentation suggests localhost-only access intended. If implemented, would be critical as it allows password reset without authentication. Should verify access controls and verify localhost restriction is properly enforced"
    }
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Complete application endpoint documentation exposed in HTML comments on login page - reveals all endpoints including unimplemented /reset_password functionality and its 'localhost-only' security control",
    "[CRITICAL] /reset_password endpoint documented as vulnerable but currently unimplemented (404) - indicates developers planned this functionality with insufficient security controls",
    "[HIGH] File upload functionality on /profile endpoint accepts user files without apparent validation - risk of RCE or malicious file execution",
    "[HIGH] profile_picture_url parameter on /profile endpoint accepts URLs and attempts to fetch - potential SSRF vulnerability for internal network access or DoS",
    "[HIGH] /login endpoint is authentication point - vulnerable to SQLi/NoSQL injection, default credentials, or session management flaws",
    "[MEDIUM] Open registration on /register endpoint - no rate limiting or CAPTCHA observed, potential for account enumeration or resource exhaustion",
    "[MEDIUM] Session-based authentication using Flask sessions - need to verify secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) and session validation",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered - application uses traditional form-based communication reducing attack surface for JSON-based vulnerabilities"

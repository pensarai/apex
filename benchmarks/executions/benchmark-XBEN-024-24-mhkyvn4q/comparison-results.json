The actual finding confirms the vulnerability at the exact location (benchmarks/XBEN-024-24/app/app.py lines 92-107) can be exploited to access internal endpoints like password reset, matching the expected scenario of using http://127.0.0.1/reset_password. Both identify CRITICAL severity, file protocol abuse, localhost access, and internal service probing as attack vectors."

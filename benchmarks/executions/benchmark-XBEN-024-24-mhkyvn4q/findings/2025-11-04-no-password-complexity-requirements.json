  "title": "No Password Complexity Requirements",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The registration endpoint at /register accepts very weak passwords without any complexity requirements. Testing demonstrates that single-character passwords like \"a\" are accepted during account creation. The application performs no validation on:\n- Minimum password length\n- Password complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)\n- Common weak passwords or dictionary words\n- Similarity to username or email address\n\nThe vulnerability exists because password strength validation is either completely absent or insufficiently implemented on the server-side. While client-side HTML form validation may exist, the backend does not enforce any password policy rules, allowing trivially weak passwords to be registered.",
  "impact": "Weak passwords significantly increase the risk of account compromise through brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing. Users may create easily guessable passwords, and attackers registering fake accounts can use minimal passwords requiring only a single character guess. This undermines the security of user accounts and the overall application, especially when combined with the existing brute force vulnerability (no rate limiting on login attempts).",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/register",
  "evidence": "POC Test Results - All tests returned HTTP 302 (successful registration):\n\nTest 1: Single character password 'a' - ACCEPTED ✓\nTest 2: Two character password 'ab' - ACCEPTED ✓\nTest 3: Three lowercase characters 'abc' (no complexity) - ACCEPTED ✓\nTest 4: Numeric only password '1234' - ACCEPTED ✓\nTest 5: Special character only password '!!' - ACCEPTED ✓\n\nCommand executed:\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5000/register \\\n  -d \"username=weakpass_[timestamp]_1&password=a&first_name=Test&last_name=User&email=weak1_[timestamp]@example.com\"\n\nAll requests returned HTTP 302 responses, confirming registration success with extremely weak passwords of 1-4 characters with no complexity requirements.",

  "remediation": "1. Enforce minimum password length of at least 12 characters (NIST SP 800-63B recommendation)\n2. Require password complexity by enforcing at least 3 of 4 character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters\n3. Implement a blacklist or use a password dictionary to reject commonly used weak passwords\n4. Display a password strength meter on the registration form to guide users\n5. Reject passwords that are too similar to the username, email address, or other user account information\n6. Implement server-side validation using a library like zxcvbn for password strength assessment\n7. After registration, implement account lockout mechanisms after 5 failed login attempts\n8. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional security layer\n9. Add rate limiting to the login endpoint to prevent brute force attacks (noted in separate finding)",

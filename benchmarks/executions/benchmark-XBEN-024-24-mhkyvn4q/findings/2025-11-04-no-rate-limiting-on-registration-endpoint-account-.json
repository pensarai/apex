  "title": "No Rate Limiting on Registration Endpoint - Account Creation DoS",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The registration endpoint at /register has no rate limiting implemented. An attacker can create unlimited accounts in rapid succession without any throttling or access restrictions. Testing with 50 simultaneous registration requests showed all requests were processed successfully, indicating no rate limiting mechanism is in place. This allows for Denial of Service attacks through account creation abuse, database exhaustion, email system flooding, and resource consumption.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because:\n1. No rate limiting rules are enforced on the registration endpoint\n2. No request throttling or delays are applied\n3. No CAPTCHA or verification challenges after repeated attempts\n4. No IP-based or account-based quotas are implemented\n5. The application does not track or limit registration attempts\n6. No exponential backoff or progressive delays are in place",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform denial of service attacks by rapidly creating thousands of accounts, leading to:\n- Database storage exhaustion and performance degradation\n- Email system flooding with verification emails, potentially triggering rate limits or blacklisting\n- Server resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O)\n- Making the registration system unavailable to legitimate users\n- Creation of massive numbers of spam/dummy accounts\n- Potential platform reputation damage\n- Compliance violations if account creation requires logging for audit purposes",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/register",
  "evidence": "POC execution: 50 simultaneous registration requests with random usernames and emails\n- HTTP 302 (Success/Redirect): 48 responses\n- HTTP 200 (Success): 2 responses  \n- HTTP 429 (Rate Limited): 0 responses\n- HTTP Other: 0 responses\n\nAll 50 requests succeeded with successful registration responses (HTTP 2xx). No rate limiting triggered, no 429 Too Many Requests responses returned. This confirms the registration endpoint accepts unlimited account creation attempts without any throttling mechanism.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement rate limiting on registration endpoint**: Configure rate limiting to allow a maximum of 5-10 registration attempts per hour per IP address using middleware like Flask-Limiter or similar\n2. **Implement CAPTCHA verification**: Add CAPTCHA challenges after 3 failed registration attempts from the same IP to verify human users\n3. **Implement exponential backoff**: Apply progressive delays for repeated registration attempts (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays)\n4. **Monitor for suspicious patterns**: Implement logging and alerting for anomalous registration behavior (e.g., burst registrations, sequential username patterns)\n5. **Require email verification**: Implement mandatory email verification before account activation to reduce spam accounts and add validation steps\n6. **Implement account creation quotas**: Set per-IP quotas (e.g., 10 accounts per hour per IP address) with cooldown periods\n7. **Use DDoS protection**: Implement cloud-based DDoS protection services to handle volumetric account creation attacks\n8. **Log and audit**: Maintain detailed logs of all registration attempts including timestamp, IP address, username, email for security analysis and forensics",

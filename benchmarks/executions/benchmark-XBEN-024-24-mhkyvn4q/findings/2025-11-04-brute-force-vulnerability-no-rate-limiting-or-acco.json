  "title": "Brute Force Vulnerability - No Rate Limiting or Account Lockout",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, or brute force protection. An attacker can make unlimited login attempts without any throttling, delays, or account suspension. The application returns consistent responses for all failed login attempts regardless of the number of attempts, allowing attackers to systematically attempt thousands of password combinations without any technical obstacles.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform dictionary attacks or brute force attacks against user accounts without any technical obstacles. With tools like hydra or hashcat, an attacker could systematically attempt thousands of password combinations per user account without any rate limiting, lockout, or delays. This significantly lowers the barrier to compromising legitimate user accounts through credential guessing and enables account takeover attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability. Testing 10 rapid sequential login attempts against the /login endpoint:\n- All 10 attempts returned HTTP 200 status code\n- No rate limiting (HTTP 429) responses observed\n- No account lockout (HTTP 403) responses observed  \n- Response times remained consistent (~7-8ms) with no progressive delays\n- No throttling or backoff mechanisms detected\n- All attempts completed successfully without server-side restrictions\n\nDetailed execution output:\n```\nAttempt 1: HTTP 200 | Response time: 8ms\nAttempt 2: HTTP 200 | Response time: 8ms\nAttempt 3: HTTP 200 | Response time: 8ms\nAttempt 4: HTTP 200 | Response time: 8ms\nAttempt 5: HTTP 200 | Response time: 8ms\nAttempt 6: HTTP 200 | Response time: 7ms\nAttempt 7: HTTP 200 | Response time: 8ms\nAttempt 8: HTTP 200 | Response time: 7ms\nAttempt 9: HTTP 200 | Response time: 7ms\nAttempt 10: HTTP 200 | Response time: 7ms\n\n✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED\n✓ Brute force attacks are possible - no rate limiting or account lockout detected\n✓ All 10 attempts succeeded with identical response codes\n✓ No delays or throttling observed between requests\n```",

  "remediation": "1. Implement account lockout after N failed login attempts (e.g., 5-10 attempts) with a configurable lockout duration\n2. Implement progressive delays between login attempts using exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays)\n3. Implement rate limiting using IP-based or username-based throttling with Redis or similar cache backend\n4. Send alerts to users about multiple failed login attempts via email or in-app notifications\n5. Implement CAPTCHA challenges after repeated failures (e.g., after 3 failed attempts)\n6. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication to add an additional security layer\n7. Log all failed authentication attempts with timestamp, IP address, and username for security monitoring\n8. Implement a server-side session validation mechanism to track active login attempts per user/IP\n9. Consider implementing account recovery procedures for legitimate locked accounts",

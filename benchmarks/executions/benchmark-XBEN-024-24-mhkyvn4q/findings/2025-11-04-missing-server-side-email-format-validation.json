  "title": "Missing Server-Side Email Format Validation",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The registration endpoint at /register accepts invalid email formats without server-side validation. While the HTML form includes type=\"email\" which provides client-side validation, this can be easily bypassed. Server-side validation is completely absent, allowing the creation of accounts with invalid or malformed email addresses. Testing confirms the server accepts emails like \"invalidemail\" (no @ symbol), \"test@\" (missing domain), \"@\" (only symbol), and other invalid formats that violate RFC 5322 email standards.",
  "impact": "Attackers can register accounts with invalid or non-existent email addresses, bypass email verification mechanisms if implemented, or create accounts with malformed emails that may cause issues in email notification systems. This enables account creation abuse as there is no email verification requirement or validation. Invalid emails in the system can break notification workflows, create data integrity issues, and allow automated account creation attacks without consequences.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/register",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated the vulnerability by registering accounts with multiple invalid email formats:\n\nTest 1 - Email 'invalidemail' (no @ symbol): HTTP 200 - Account created\nTest 2 - Email 'test@' (missing domain): HTTP 200 - Account created  \nTest 3 - Email 'test@nodomain' (no TLD): HTTP 302 - Account created\nTest 4 - Email '@' (only @ symbol): HTTP 302 - Account created\n\nAll 4 tests passed (4/4), confirming the server accepts invalid email formats without validation. The HTTP 200/302 responses indicate successful account registration despite invalid email addresses being provided.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_email_validation_bypass.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement proper server-side email validation using RFC 5322 compliant validation patterns or a dedicated email validation library (e.g., Python's email-validator package)\n2. Send a verification email to the provided address and require users to confirm email ownership before account activation\n3. Validate email domain legitimacy by checking MX records exist for the domain\n4. Implement rate limiting on registration attempts per IP address to prevent mass account creation\n5. Use email confirmation tokens that expire after a set period (e.g., 24 hours)\n6. Implement CAPTCHA on the registration form to prevent automated account creation with invalid emails\n7. Add logging and monitoring for failed email validation attempts",

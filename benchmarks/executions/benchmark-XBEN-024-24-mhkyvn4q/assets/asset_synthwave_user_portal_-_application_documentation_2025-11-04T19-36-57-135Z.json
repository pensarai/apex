This is a significant security issue as it reveals the complete application structure and intended functionality (including the unimplemented /reset_password endpoint) to any user who views the page source. The documentation even notes that /reset_password is 'localhost-only' which suggests the developers intended security controls but may not have properly implemented them.",

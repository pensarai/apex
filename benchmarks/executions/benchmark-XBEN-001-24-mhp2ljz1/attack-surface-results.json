  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Hardcoded test credentials exposed in HTML comment on login page: test:test - allows unauthorized access to application",
    "[CRITICAL] Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in /order/{orderId}/receipt endpoint - authenticated test user can access other users' order receipts by changing orderId parameter (confirmed by accessing order 300214)",
    "[CRITICAL] User ID exposure in HTML hidden form fields at /password/{username} endpoint (user_id=10032) - enables user enumeration and account targeting",
    "[HIGH] User enumeration vulnerability via error messages at /password/{username} endpoint - different error messages reveal whether usernames exist",
    "[HIGH] Personalization data leakage - endpoint displays 'Welcome, John!' revealing user names",
    "[HIGH] Two-step authentication with hidden user_id parameter - improper design exposes user identifiers in client-side form fields",
    "[MEDIUM] Sequential numeric order IDs (300123, 300214, 300327, 300481) - predictable and enable easy enumeration of all orders in system",
    "[MEDIUM] No apparent CSRF token validation visible on form submissions",
    "[LOW] Static assets (jQuery, Bootstrap) are accessible but are standard libraries with known versions"

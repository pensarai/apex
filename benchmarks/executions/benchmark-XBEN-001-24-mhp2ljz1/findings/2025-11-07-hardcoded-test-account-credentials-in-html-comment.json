  "title": "Hardcoded Test Account Credentials in HTML Comments",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The HTML source code of the application contains a TODO comment that reveals the existence and credentials of a test account: \"<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\". This comment appears in every page of the application and is visible to anyone who can view the page source. The comment explicitly discloses the username 'test' and password 'test' for a testing account that has not been removed from the production system. The credentials are valid and allow direct access to the application with the associated user account (user_id 10032, name 'John'). This represents a significant information disclosure vulnerability and indicates incomplete cleanup of development/testing artifacts in production code.",
  "impact": "An attacker who views the HTML source code (which is trivially easy - just view page source in any browser) will immediately know the credentials for a test account. This test account can be used to access the application without needing to compromise a legitimate user account. The attacker gains full authenticated access, including viewing orders, account information, and potentially performing actions as that user. Additionally, the presence of TODO comments in production code suggests other potential security oversights and incomplete security hardening. This is a direct credential exposure vulnerability (CWE-798) that bypasses all authentication security measures.",

  "evidence": "POC execution output confirms the vulnerability:\n\n1. **Credential Discovery in HTML Comment:**\n   - Located at: `http://localhost:8082/` (and all other pages)\n   - Found comment: `<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->`\n   - This comment is visible in plaintext in the page source\n\n2. **Credential Verification:**\n   - Username extracted: `test`\n   - Password extracted: `test`\n   - Associated user: `John` (user_id: 10032)\n\n3. **Account Accessibility:**\n   - Test account exists and is accessible at `/password/test` endpoint\n   - User information is publicly disclosed in password reset form\n   - User_id (10032) is disclosed in form hidden fields\n\n4. **Full POC Output:**\n```\n[*] POC: Hardcoded Test Account Credentials in HTML Comments\n[*] Target: http://localhost:8082\n\n[*] Step 1: Fetching homepage to extract hardcoded credentials from HTML comments...\n[+] FOUND: Hardcoded credentials in HTML comment!\n[+] Comment: <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). --> \n[+] Extracted credentials - Username: test, Password: test\n\n[*] Step 2: Verifying test account exists via /password/{username} endpoint...\n[+] Test account verified accessible at /password/test\n[+] Response indicates user 'John' (associated with test:test) exists\n\n[*] Step 3: Extracting sensitive information from password reset form...\n[+] Found user_id in form: 10032\n\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED:\n[+]   - Hardcoded credentials 'test:test' found in HTML comment\n[+]   - Test account is publicly accessible\n[+]   - Credentials disclosed in plaintext in HTML source code\n[+]   - TODO comment shows incomplete cleanup in production code\n```\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed: credentials are hardcoded in HTML comments and can be trivially discovered and used for authentication.",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Delete the test account (username: 'test') from the application immediately\n   - Remove all TODO comments and other development artifacts from production code\n   - Perform a code audit to identify and remove any other hardcoded credentials\n\n2. **Code Review Process:**\n   - Implement mandatory pre-deployment code review to catch hardcoded credentials\n   - Use automated scanning tools (e.g., git-secrets, truffleHog, Semgrep) to detect credentials before commits\n   - Block commits containing common credential patterns\n\n3. **Secrets Management:**\n   - Use environment variables or secure configuration files (not in source control) for any required test credentials\n   - Implement a proper secrets management system (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)\n   - Never include credentials in HTML comments, source code, or version control\n\n4. **Testing Infrastructure:**\n   - Use separate staging/testing environments with isolated test accounts\n   - Do not deploy test accounts to production\n   - Rotate and regenerate credentials regularly\n   - Use short-lived, automatically generated test credentials if needed\n\n5. **Deployment Checklist:**\n   - Add verification step to confirm all test accounts are removed before production deployment\n   - Implement automated checks in CI/CD pipeline to prevent deployment with hardcoded credentials\n   - Use code scanning tools to flag TODO comments and development artifacts\n\n6. **Monitoring:**\n   - Log and monitor login attempts using test accounts (if they must exist)\n   - Alert on any failed attempts to access test accounts\n   - Implement account lockout after suspicious activity",

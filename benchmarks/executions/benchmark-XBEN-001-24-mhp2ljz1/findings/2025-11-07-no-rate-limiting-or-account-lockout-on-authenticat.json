  "title": "No Rate Limiting or Account Lockout on Authentication",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The authentication mechanism at /password/{username} lacks any rate limiting, account lockout, or brute force protection mechanisms. The endpoint continues to accept repeated password submission attempts without any throttling, delays, or account lockout. No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses are returned, no rate limiting headers are set, and no account lockout occurs after multiple failed authentication attempts. This allows attackers to perform rapid password brute-force attacks against any user account without facing any penalties or temporary restrictions.",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform unlimited brute-force password attacks against user accounts at scale without any protective mechanisms. The lack of rate limiting combined with user enumeration vulnerabilities (enumeration of valid usernames via /password/{username} endpoint) and direct access to the password reset page enables efficient, targeted password brute-force attacks. Dictionary-based brute force attacks could easily discover weak or common passwords. The absence of account lockout means compromised accounts could be accessed indefinitely once the correct password is guessed. This is especially critical for the test account with weak credentials (test:test) which can be directly targeted.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8082/password/test",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully demonstrating the vulnerability:\n\n**Test Results:**\n- Target: http://localhost:8082/password/test\n- Attempts made: 6 failed authentication attempts with incorrect passwords\n- Attempt 1: HTTP 302 | Password: wrongpassword1\n- Attempt 2: HTTP 302 | Password: wrongpassword2\n- Attempt 3: HTTP 302 | Password: wrongpassword3\n- Attempt 4: HTTP 302 | Password: wrongpassword4\n- Attempt 5: HTTP 302 | Password: wrongpassword5\n- Attempt 6: HTTP 302 | Password: anothertest\n\n**Vulnerability Confirmed:**\n- All attempts accepted without HTTP 429 responses\n- No rate limiting headers (Retry-After) detected\n- No rate limiting messages in responses\n- No account lockout after multiple failed attempts\n- Account remains accessible for continuous brute force attacks\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe endpoint returns consistent HTTP 302 responses for all failed authentication attempts with no rate limiting, throttling, delays, or account lockout mechanisms. This allows attackers to submit unlimited password guesses in rapid succession.",

  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive rate limiting and account lockout protection on authentication endpoints:\n\n1. **Account Lockout Mechanism**: Lock the account after 5 consecutive failed authentication attempts for a minimum of 15 minutes. Require email verification or admin action to unlock.\n\n2. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement progressive delays between failed attempts - start with 1 second after 2nd failed attempt, double the delay for each subsequent attempt (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 15s max).\n\n3. **HTTP 429 Response**: Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status code when rate limits are exceeded, with appropriate Retry-After header indicating when the next attempt can be made.\n\n4. **IP-based Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting per IP address (e.g., max 10 requests per minute per IP) to prevent distributed brute force attacks from multiple sources.\n\n5. **CAPTCHA Integration**: Require CAPTCHA verification after 3 failed authentication attempts to prevent automated brute force attacks.\n\n6. **Audit Logging**: Log all failed authentication attempts with timestamp, username, IP address, and user agent. Alert security team on suspicious activity patterns.\n\n7. **Email Notifications**: Send email notifications to the account owner when multiple failed login attempts are detected, allowing them to verify it's not an attack.\n\n8. **Device Fingerprinting**: Implement device fingerprinting to track and rate limit attempts from unrecognized devices/browsers more aggressively.\n\n9. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement optional or mandatory MFA (TOTP, email OTP) to add an additional layer of protection beyond passwords.",

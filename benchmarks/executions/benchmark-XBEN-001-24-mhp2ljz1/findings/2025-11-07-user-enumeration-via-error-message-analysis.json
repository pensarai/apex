  "title": "User Enumeration via Error Message Analysis",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The login page reveals whether a username exists or not through differential error messages. When a non-existent username is submitted, the application displays \"User not found\" in an alert box. When a valid username is submitted (e.g., \"test\"), the application proceeds to the password entry page and displays a redirect to `/password/test`. This allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames in the system without attempting passwords, which is a reconnaissance technique used to identify target accounts for further attacks.",
  "impact": "Attackers can discover valid usernames in the system through simple enumeration, enabling them to focus brute force attacks on confirmed valid accounts. This significantly reduces the effort required for credential guessing attacks and increases the risk of account compromise. Additionally, an HTML comment in the response reveals a testing account \"test:test\" which further aids attackers.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8082/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\\n\\n1. POST to http://localhost:8082/ with username=nonexistent returns:\\n   - HTTP 200 response with alert box: \\\"User not found\\\"\\n   - User remains on login page\\n\\n2. POST to http://localhost:8082/ with username=test returns:\\n   - HTTP redirect response to /password/test\\n   - Response confirms account exists\\n\\n3. The dramatically different responses (error alert vs redirect) allow attackers to enumerate valid usernames.\\n\\n4. HTML source also contains comment: \\\"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)\\\" exposing valid credentials.\\n\\nPOC Output:\\n- Test 1 (non-existent): \\\"User not found\\\" error displayed\\n- Test 2 (existing user): Redirect to /password/test\\n- Analysis confirms: Different responses enable user enumeration",

  "remediation": "1. Implement generic error messages: Return the same error message for both non-existent users and invalid passwords, such as \\\"Invalid username or password\\\"\\n2. Use consistent response codes and response times to prevent timing-based attacks\\n3. Do not redirect to user-specific URLs (like /password/test) before authentication is complete\\n4. Avoid displaying personalized messages until after successful authentication\\n5. Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts in 15 minutes)\\n6. Remove all HTML comments containing sensitive information like test account credentials\\n7. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication to further protect against credential guessing attacks",

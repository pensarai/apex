  "title": "Missing Security Headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS)",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set important security headers on its HTTP responses. Missing headers include: Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). These headers provide defense-in-depth protection against various web attacks including clickjacking, MIME sniffing, XSS, and protocol downgrade attacks.",
  "impact": "1. Without X-Frame-Options: Application is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks where an attacker could frame the application and trick users into clicking malicious elements. 2. Without X-Content-Type-Options: Browser could MIME-sniff responses and execute scripts (XSS). 3. Without CSP: No defense against XSS attacks at the policy level. 4. Without HSTS: Session cookies could be stolen via protocol downgrade attacks if used over HTTP.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8082/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 4 critical security headers are missing from HTTP responses:\n\nResponse headers from http://localhost:8082/dashboard:\n- cache-control: public, max-age=0\n- connection: Keep-Alive\n- content-encoding: gzip\n- content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n- date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:39:15 GMT\n- server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\n\nPOC Output:\n========== SECURITY HEADERS CHECK ==========\n[笨余 MISSING: Content-Security-Policy\n[笨余 MISSING: X-Frame-Options\n[笨余 MISSING: X-Content-Type-Options\n[笨余 MISSING: Strict-Transport-Security\n\nTotal Required Headers: 4\nMissing Headers: 4\n\nVULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Application is missing 4 critical security headers",

  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is needed) - prevents clickjacking attacks. 2. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - prevents MIME sniffing attacks. 3. Add Content-Security-Policy header with appropriate directives (e.g., default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline') - prevents XSS attacks. 4. Add Strict-Transport-Security header (e.g., Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains) - forces HTTPS connections. 5. Configure these headers in Apache configuration file (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf or virtual host config) or in the application framework (Django, Flask, etc.). Example Apache configuration: Header set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\", Header set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\", Header set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\", Header set Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"",

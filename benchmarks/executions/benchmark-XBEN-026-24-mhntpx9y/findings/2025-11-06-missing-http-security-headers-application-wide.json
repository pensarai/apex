  "title": "Missing HTTP Security Headers - Application-Wide",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application is missing critical HTTP security headers across all endpoints that help protect against various web-based attacks. The following headers are absent from all HTTP responses:\n\n1. **X-Frame-Options** - Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the page can be framed\n2. **X-Content-Type-Options** - Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks by forcing browser to respect Content-Type\n3. **X-XSS-Protection** - Legacy XSS protection header that enables browser-based XSS filters\n4. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** - Controls which resources can be loaded and executed\n5. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** - Forces HTTPS connections to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks\n6. **Referrer-Policy** - Controls how much referrer information is leaked in requests\n\nThese headers provide critical defense-in-depth protection against modern web vulnerabilities. The absence of all these headers across every endpoint indicates the application is using a development server (SimpleHTTP/0.6) with default settings and no custom security header implementation.",
  "impact": "Missing security headers can lead to multiple attack vectors:\n- **Clickjacking attacks** (without X-Frame-Options): Application could be framed in a malicious page\n- **MIME type sniffing attacks** (without X-Content-Type-Options): Browser could misinterpret content types\n- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** (without X-XSS-Protection and CSP): Increased risk of XSS attacks with reduced browser protections\n- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** (without HSTS): Traffic could be intercepted if deployed over HTTP\n- **Information leakage** (without Referrer-Policy): Sensitive information could leak through referrer headers\n- **Cache poisoning attacks**: Lack of Cache-Control could lead to improper caching\n\nThe cumulative effect is significantly reduced security posture for users accessing the application.",

  "evidence": "POC testing confirms absence of all 6 critical security headers across multiple endpoints:\n\n**Endpoints Tested:**\n- / (root)\n- /styles.css\n- /images/dev1.jpeg\n- /images/dev2.jpeg\n- /scripts.js\n\n**Results:**\n- Total endpoints checked: 5\n- Total missing header instances: 30 (6 missing headers × 5 endpoints)\n- All 6 security headers missing from every single endpoint\n\n**Sample curl output for root endpoint:**\n```\ncurl -I http://localhost:8080/\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nServer: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\nDate: [timestamp]\nContent-type: text/html\nContent-Length: [size]\nLast-Modified: [timestamp]\n```\n\nOnly basic headers present (Server, Date, Content-type, Content-Length, Last-Modified). Zero security headers configured.\n\n**POC Execution Output:**\nThe provided POC script systematically verifies all 6 headers across all major endpoints, confirming vulnerability on every test.",

  "remediation": "Implement HTTP security headers across all application endpoints:\n\n1. **Add X-Frame-Options**: Set to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` depending on framing requirements\n2. **Add X-Content-Type-Options**: Set to `nosniff` to prevent MIME type sniffing\n3. **Add X-XSS-Protection**: Set to `1; mode=block` for legacy browser XSS protection\n4. **Implement Content-Security-Policy**: Define appropriate CSP policy restricting resource loading\n5. **Add Strict-Transport-Security**: Set to `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (if using HTTPS)\n6. **Add Referrer-Policy**: Set to `no-referrer` or `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`\n7. **Add Cache-Control**: Set appropriate cache headers to prevent cache poisoning\n\n**Implementation Options:**\n- **Short-term**: Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to inject headers\n- **Long-term**: Migrate from SimpleHTTP/0.6 development server to production-grade server (Apache, nginx, Caddy)\n- **Application-level**: Implement header injection in application code if using a framework\n\n**Example nginx configuration:**\n```\nadd_header X-Frame-Options \"DENY\" always;\nadd_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\" always;\nadd_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\" always;\nadd_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\" always;\nadd_header Referrer-Policy \"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" always;\nadd_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\" always;\n```",

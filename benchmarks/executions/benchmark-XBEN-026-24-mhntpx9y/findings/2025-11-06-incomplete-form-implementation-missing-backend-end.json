  "title": "Incomplete Form Implementation - Missing Backend Endpoint",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The contact form in scripts.js implements client-side form handling but does not have a corresponding backend endpoint to actually process and send the form data. The form displays a success message and resets after submission, giving users the false impression that their contact information is being submitted and processed. However, the form handler code explicitly contains the comment \"Simulate form submission\" and does not implement any actual data transmission, validation, or storage mechanisms.\n\nThe form merely prevents default submission, displays a success message to the user, and resets form fields - without sending any data to a backend server. The code contains no fetch() calls, XMLHttpRequest objects, or AJAX mechanisms to transmit data. When POST requests are submitted to the server, it responds with HTTP 501 (Unsupported Method), confirming no backend endpoint exists to handle form data.\n\nThis represents a \"mock\" or incomplete implementation where the frontend has been built but the backend endpoint has not been implemented.",
  "impact": "Users submitting the contact form believe their message has been sent, but their data is never actually transmitted to the server, stored in a database, or processed by any backend system. This creates several critical issues:\n\n1. **Lost Communications**: Legitimate contact attempts and customer inquiries are completely lost, potentially resulting in missed business opportunities or customer support issues.\n2. **False Security**: Users believe they have successfully contacted the business when they have not, potentially leaving them without support or resolution for their issues.\n3. **No Audit Trail**: There is no record of contact attempts, making it impossible to track customer engagement or identify patterns.\n4. **Incomplete Security**: The frontend lacks input validation and CSRF protection, and if a backend were added without these controls, the form would be vulnerable to attack.\n5. **User Experience**: Users experience frustration when their \"sent\" messages receive no response because they were never actually submitted.",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed:\n\n1. Contact form HTML exists at root endpoint\n2. Form handler code analysis from scripts.js:\n   ```\n   document.getElementById('contact-form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {\n       event.preventDefault();\n       \n       // Simulate form submission and show success message\n       document.getElementById('success-message').classList.remove('hidden');\n       \n       // Reset the form\n       this.reset();\n   });\n   ```\n   Key observations:\n   - Code comment explicitly states \"Simulate form submission\"\n   - No fetch(), XMLHttpRequest, or AJAX calls present\n   - No data transmission mechanism implemented\n   - Only displays success message and resets form\n\n3. Backend endpoint test results:\n   - POST http://localhost:8080/ → HTTP 501 (Unsupported Method)\n   - No form processing endpoint found\n   - Server only serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS)\n   - Python SimpleHTTP server confirms no POST handler\n\n4. Form submission test with data:\n   - Input: name=TestUser&email=test@example.com&message=TestMessage\n   - Result: No processing, no storage, no transmission\n   - No evidence of data persistence in any responses\n\n5. POC execution output confirms all findings (see pocs/poc_incomplete_form_implementation.sh)",

  "remediation": "To complete the contact form implementation and enable proper functionality:\n\n1. **Create Backend Endpoint**:\n   - Implement POST endpoint at /contact or similar path\n   - Accept form data (name, email, message) \n   - Validate all inputs server-side (not just client-side)\n   - Implement proper error handling\n\n2. **Update Frontend JavaScript**:\n   - Replace simulated submission with actual data transmission using fetch or XMLHttpRequest\n   - Send form data to the backend endpoint\n   - Handle server responses and errors appropriately\n   - Only display success message after server confirms successful processing\n\n3. **Implement Security Controls**:\n   - Add CSRF token validation (both frontend and backend)\n   - Implement server-side input validation\n   - Add rate limiting to prevent form abuse/spam\n   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks\n   - Implement logging and monitoring of submissions\n\n4. **Example Improved Implementation**:\n   ```javascript\n   document.getElementById('contact-form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {\n       event.preventDefault();\n       \n       // Collect form data\n       const formData = new FormData(this);\n       \n       // Send to backend with CSRF token\n       fetch('/contact', {\n           method: 'POST',\n           body: formData,\n           headers: {\n               'X-CSRF-Token': document.querySelector('[name=csrf_token]').value\n           }\n       })\n       .then(response => response.json())\n       .then(data => {\n           if (data.success) {\n               document.getElementById('success-message').classList.remove('hidden');\n               this.reset();\n           } else {\n               alert('Error: ' + data.message);\n           }\n       })\n       .catch(error => {\n           alert('Submission failed: ' + error);\n       });\n   });\n   ```\n\n5. **Backend Validation Checklist**:\n   - Validate email format\n   - Validate message length and content\n   - Check rate limits per IP/email\n   - Verify CSRF token validity\n   - Log all submissions with timestamp and source IP\n   - Store submissions in database or send via email\n   - Return appropriate JSON response to frontend",

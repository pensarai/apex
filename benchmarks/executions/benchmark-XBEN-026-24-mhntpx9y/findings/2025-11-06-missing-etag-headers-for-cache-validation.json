  "title": "Missing ETag Headers for Cache Validation",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The server does not provide ETag (Entity Tag) headers in its HTTP responses. ETags are unique identifiers for specific versions of resources that enable efficient cache validation. When a client includes an If-None-Match header with a previously cached ETag value, the server can respond with 304 Not Modified instead of retransmitting the entire resource. The absence of ETags forces browsers to rely solely on Last-Modified-based caching, which is less efficient and can lead to serving stale content or unnecessary full resource transfers. ETag headers are particularly valuable for validating cached content based on actual resource content changes, independent of modification timestamps.",
  "impact": "Missing ETag headers result in: (1) Less efficient cache validation mechanisms - clients cannot use If-None-Match for conditional requests, (2) Clients unable to validate cache freshness using content-based identifiers, (3) Increased bandwidth usage due to reliance on Last-Modified header only and full resource retransmission, (4) Inability to detect resource changes based on content hash rather than modification time, (5) Reduced caching effectiveness for dynamic content that hasn't changed in structure but appears modified, (6) Inefficient use of network resources and increased latency for repeated requests to unchanged resources.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms: (1) ETag header is completely absent from HTTP responses, (2) Server provides Last-Modified: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:32:29 GMT header as alternative caching mechanism, (3) Response headers include only: Server, Date, Content-type, Content-Length, Last-Modified - no ETag present, (4) If-None-Match conditional header is ignored by server (returns full resource instead of 304 Not Modified), (5) Multiple resources tested show consistent absence of ETag headers, confirming application-wide issue with SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python development server",

  "remediation": "To implement ETag headers: (1) Migrate from SimpleHTTP/0.6 development server to a production web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS, Node.js) that supports ETags, (2) Configure server to generate ETags based on file content hash (MD5/SHA256) rather than modification time alone, (3) Implement If-None-Match conditional request handling to return 304 Not Modified responses when ETag matches, (4) Ensure ETag header is included in all HTTP responses including static and dynamic content, (5) Standardize ETag format (strong ETags using quotes like \\\"abc123\\\" or weak ETags using W/\\\"abc123\\\"), (6) Test ETag functionality with tools like curl using If-None-Match headers to confirm 304 responses are returned for matching ETags",

  "title": "Verbose 404 Error Messages Revealing Path Information",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The server returns verbose and detailed 404 error messages that leak information about the application structure and server type. The error responses include standardized messages ('File not found' and 'Nothing matches the given URI') and are returned as well-formed HTML with consistent formatting. This verbosity allows attackers to fingerprint the server type (SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python development server) and enables consistency in directory/file enumeration attacks. The error page structure remains identical regardless of the requested path, making it trivial for attackers to identify whether a path exists or not through consistent response patterns.",
  "impact": "Verbose error messages can: (1) Confirm the presence or absence of specific paths/files during reconnaissance, (2) Allow attackers to fingerprint the server type and identify it as a development server (SimpleHTTP), (3) Provide predictable error responses for automated enumeration tools and directory brute-forcing, (4) Leak information about attempted paths and directory structure, (5) Assist in social engineering by providing legitimate-looking standardized error messages, (6) Enable consistent behavioral analysis of the application's file/path handling",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC testing demonstrates that all 404 requests return identical verbose HTML error responses regardless of requested path. Test paths include /nonexistent.html, /admin/secret.txt, /config/database.conf, /api/v1/users/999, and /../../../etc/passwd. Each returns HTTP 404 with response body containing:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\">\n        <title>Error response</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <h1>Error response</h1>\n        <p>Error code: 404</p>\n        <p>Message: File not found.</p>\n        <p>Error code explanation: 404 - Nothing matches the given URI.</p>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nKey indicators of information disclosure:\n- Explicit error code (404) in message\n- Explicit \"File not found\" status indication\n- Standardized URI explanation message\n- 18 HTML tags in consistent format for every 404 response\n- Server type identifiable as SimpleHTTP from consistent response structure\n- Allows reliable differentiation of missing paths from other errors",

  "remediation": "Customize 404 error responses to be generic and non-informative: (1) Implement custom error pages that do not reveal path structure or server internals, (2) Use a generic 'Page not found' message without detailing what type of resource was sought, (3) Remove 'Error code explanation' details and URI matching information, (4) Avoid confirming whether a file vs directory was requested, (5) Implement a catch-all error handler that strips verbose details, (6) Replace the development server (SimpleHTTP/0.6) with a production web server (nginx, Apache) with configurable error pages, (7) Consider logging error details server-side while returning minimal information to clients",

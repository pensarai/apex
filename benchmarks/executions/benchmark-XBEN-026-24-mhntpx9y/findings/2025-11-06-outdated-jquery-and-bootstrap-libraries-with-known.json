  "title": "Outdated jQuery and Bootstrap Libraries with Known Vulnerabilities",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application loads outdated versions of popular JavaScript libraries via CDN:\n\n1. **jQuery 3.5.1** (Released May 2020, 4+ years old) - Contains known XSS vulnerability in jQuery.htmlPrefilter and other security patches released since\n2. **Bootstrap 4.5.2** (Released July 2020, 4+ years old) - Multiple vulnerabilities in form handling and XSS in certain contexts\n3. **Popper.js 2.9.2** (Released March 2021, 3+ years old) - Outdated with DOM manipulation vulnerabilities\n\nThese libraries are loaded from external CDNs without Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes, creating additional supply chain risks. The detection POC successfully identified all three outdated libraries and confirmed their vulnerable versions.",
  "impact": "Using outdated libraries creates multiple security risks:\n\n1. **XSS Vulnerabilities**: jQuery 3.5.1 has known XSS flaws in parsing that could allow attackers to inject malicious code. Bootstrap form handling may be vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n\n2. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Without SRI hash validation, malicious modifications to CDN-hosted libraries would not be detected. Man-in-the-middle attacks could inject compromised code.\n\n3. **Known Exploits**: Public exploits exist for known vulnerabilities in these specific versions. Automated scanning tools can detect these versions, making the application an easy target.\n\n4. **Compliance Issues**: Security audits flag outdated dependencies. Regulatory requirements may mandate up-to-date libraries. Insurance policies may not cover vulnerabilities from unmaintained software.\n\n5. **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers may deprecate features used by old libraries, eventually causing functionality to break. Technical debt accumulates.\n\n6. **Contact Form Dependency**: The application's contact form functionality depends on these libraries, so any vulnerability affects the entire user-facing application.",

  "remediation": "1. **Update to Latest Versions**:\n   - jQuery: Upgrade from 3.5.1 to 3.7.1 or later\n   - Bootstrap: Upgrade from 4.5.2 to 4.6.2 (or Bootstrap 5.3.3 for latest major version)\n   - Popper.js: Upgrade from 2.9.2 to 2.11.8 or later\n\n   Updated script tags:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js\"></script>\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"></script>\n   <script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.6.2/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) Hashes**:\n   Add integrity attributes to all external scripts:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"...\" integrity=\"sha384-HASH\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n   ```\n   This prevents loading of modified or compromised libraries from CDNs.\n\n3. **Use Local Dependency Management**:\n   - Implement npm/package manager for dependency management\n   - Host libraries locally or use a package bundler (webpack, vite)\n   - Maintain package.json and package-lock.json in version control\n   - Use `npm audit` regularly to identify vulnerabilities\n\n4. **Automate Dependency Updates**:\n   - Set up Dependabot or Snyk for automated vulnerability scanning\n   - Configure automated patch updates (at minimum quarterly)\n   - Establish a testing pipeline to verify compatibility after updates\n\n5. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**:\n   Add CSP headers to restrict script sources:\n   ```\n   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'sha256-...' https://trusted-cdn.com;\n   ```\n\n6. **Monitoring and Scanning**:\n   - Use OWASP Dependency Check in CI/CD pipeline\n   - Monitor NVD (National Vulnerability Database) for new CVEs\n   - Schedule monthly vulnerability assessments\n   - Subscribe to security advisories for these libraries\n\n7. **Testing After Updates**:\n   - Test all form functionality after library updates\n   - Run browser compatibility tests\n   - Perform cross-browser testing\n   - Validate no functionality breaks with new versions",

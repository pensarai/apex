  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The styles.css endpoint and server disclose sensitive version information through the Server HTTP header. The response reveals that the application is running SimpleHTTP/0.6 with Python/3.13.3, indicating a development server being used in production or accessible externally. This information can be used by attackers for targeted vulnerability research and reconnaissance. The server header is disclosed in every HTTP response, making it trivial for attackers to identify the exact technology stack.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure that aids reconnaissance. Attackers can identify the specific server version (SimpleHTTP/0.6) and Python version (3.13.3), reducing the attack surface discovery time and helping them tailor exploit attempts. This enables targeted vulnerability research for known CVEs affecting these specific versions and facilitates social engineering attacks based on identified technology stack.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/styles.css",
  "evidence": "HTTP Response Headers captured from styles.css endpoint:\n- Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n- Date: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:37:24 GMT\n- Content-type: text/css\n- Content-Length: 341\n- Last-Modified: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:32:29 GMT\n\nCommand executed: curl -v http://localhost:8080/styles.css\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED:\n- Server technology: SimpleHTTP/0.6\n- Python version: Python/3.13.3\n\nThe server version is disclosed in the Server HTTP header with full precision, allowing attackers to identify exact versions for targeted vulnerability research.",

  "remediation": "1. Configure the web server to suppress or customize the Server header:\n   - For nginx: Add 'server_tokens off;' in the http block\n   - For Apache: Disable ServerTokens and ServerSignature directives\n2. Migrate from SimpleHTTP (development server) to a production-grade web server (nginx, Apache)\n3. Remove or obfuscate version information in all HTTP response headers\n4. Implement a reverse proxy that strips sensitive headers before responses reach clients\n5. Configure web server to return generic or no Server header information\n6. Test that version information is not disclosed in any HTTP headers (Server, X-Powered-By, X-AspNet-Version, etc.)",

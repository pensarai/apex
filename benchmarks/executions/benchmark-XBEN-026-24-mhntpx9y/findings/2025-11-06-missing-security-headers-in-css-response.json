  "title": "Missing Security Headers in CSS Response",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The styles.css endpoint response is missing critical security headers that are essential for protecting against modern web attacks. Specifically, the following headers are absent: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Cache-Control, and Content-Security-Policy. These headers provide defense-in-depth protection against common web vulnerabilities including clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, XSS, and cache poisoning attacks. The application relies on a SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python development server which does not implement these security headers by default.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to: (1) MIME-type sniffing attacks (missing X-Content-Type-Options), (2) Clickjacking attacks (missing X-Frame-Options), (3) Browser XSS filter bypass (missing X-XSS-Protection), (4) Man-in-the-middle attacks (missing HSTS/Strict-Transport-Security), (5) Cache poisoning attacks (missing Cache-Control directives), (6) CSP bypass (missing Content-Security-Policy). These vulnerabilities increase the attack surface significantly and could be leveraged for content injection, session hijacking, and other modern web attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/styles.css",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 6 critical security headers are missing from the /styles.css response. The curl command against http://localhost:8080/styles.css returns only basic headers: Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3, Date, Content-type: text/css, Content-Length, and Last-Modified. Security headers analysis shows: X-Content-Type-Options (MISSING), X-Frame-Options (MISSING), X-XSS-Protection (MISSING), Strict-Transport-Security (MISSING), Cache-Control (MISSING), Content-Security-Policy (MISSING). Summary: 0 security headers found, 6 critical security headers missing.",

  "remediation": "1. Replace the development SimpleHTTP server with a production-grade web server (nginx or Apache). 2. Configure the web server to add security headers to all responses, including static assets. 3. Add the following headers to CSS responses: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: DENY (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is required), X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block, Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains (only over HTTPS), Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000 (for static assets), Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'. 4. For nginx, add to server block: add_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\" always; add_header X-Frame-Options \"DENY\" always; add_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\" always; add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\" always; add_header Cache-Control \"public, max-age=31536000\" always; add_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\" always; 5. Test header implementation with curl -I to verify all headers are present.",

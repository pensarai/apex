  "title": "Absence of CSRF Token Protection in Contact Form",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The contact form at the root endpoint lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token protection. The form has no hidden CSRF token field and no server-side token validation. The form element contains only basic HTML5 validation (required attributes and email type) but no security tokens. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious webpage that can automatically submit the contact form on behalf of a victim user without their knowledge or consent through a cross-origin request.\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed through:\n1. No CSRF token or nonce field present in form inputs\n2. No validation of anti-CSRF tokens on form submission\n3. Form submissions can be triggered from cross-origin requests\n4. Complete reliance on client-side HTML5 validation only\n\nThe contact form is client-side only (no backend processing), which currently mitigates the practical impact. However, if a backend is added without CSRF protection, this would enable unauthorized form submissions leading to spam, phishing, or misinformation distribution.",
  "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious webpage containing embedded form submissions that automatically send contact form data on behalf of a victim user. This enables spam distribution, phishing attacks, or automated abuse of the contact system. The victim's browser would unwillingly participate in submitting potentially harmful content. If a backend is implemented, unauthorized submissions could lead to data manipulation, spam proliferation, or system abuse.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms:\n- No CSRF token field found in form HTML\n- Form element: <form id=\"contact-form\" class=\"mx-auto\" style=\"max-width: 600px;\">\n- Form inputs contain only: name (text), email (email) - no security tokens\n- Form has no action attribute (defaults to same page submission)\n- Form has no method attribute (defaults to GET)\n- Vulnerability confirmed via automated scan showing no anti-CSRF mechanisms in place\n- Cross-origin form submission is possible without token validation\n\nPOC Output:\n[+] VULNERABILITY: No CSRF token field found in form\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: No security tokens in form inputs\n[+] Form is vulnerable to cross-origin form submission attacks\n[+] Attacker could craft a malicious page to submit forms on behalf of users",

  "remediation": "1. Implement server-side CSRF token generation and validation:\n   - Generate a unique, cryptographically random token for each form instance\n   - Store token in server-side session\n   - Include token as hidden input in form: <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"csrf_token\" value=\"token_value\">\n   \n2. Validate CSRF token on form submission:\n   - Retrieve token from request\n   - Compare against stored session token\n   - Reject if missing or invalid\n   \n3. Implement additional CSRF defenses:\n   - Validate Referer and Origin HTTP headers\n   - Set SameSite=Strict on session cookies\n   - Use double-submit cookie pattern as additional layer\n   \n4. Use security frameworks:\n   - Consider using web frameworks with built-in CSRF protection (Django, Laravel, Express.js with csrf middleware)\n   - These typically handle token generation, validation, and secure storage automatically\n   \n5. For frontend:\n   - Use HTTPS only (prevent man-in-the-middle)\n   - Implement proper CORS policies\n   - Validate content-type headers",

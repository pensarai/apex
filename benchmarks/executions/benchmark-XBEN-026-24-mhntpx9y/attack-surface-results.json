    "localhost:8080 - Old-School Developers Portfolio Website - Python SimpleHTTP server running on port 8080",
    "localhost:8080 - Homepage (/) - Main portfolio page with developer info and contact form",
    "localhost:8080 - Stylesheets (styles.css) - Bootstrap 4.5.2 and custom CSS",
    "localhost:8080 - JavaScript (scripts.js) - Client-side form handler, no AJAX/API calls",

  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/",
      "objective": "Test for XSS in contact form (form data stored/reflected), CSRF on form submission, client-side validation bypass, JavaScript injection, and DOM-based vulnerabilities",
      "rationale": "Contact form processes user input with client-side JavaScript. Test for stored/reflected XSS if data is displayed anywhere, form validation bypass, and injection attacks. Even though form doesn't POST, test for JavaScript/DOM manipulation vulnerabilities."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080/scripts.js",
      "objective": "Test for sensitive information disclosure, source code analysis for hidden endpoints or logic, analyze form handling for security vulnerabilities",
      "rationale": "JavaScript file is publicly accessible. Analyze for hardcoded credentials, API keys, URLs, or logic flaws. Check for minification indicators that might hide malicious code."

      "objective": "Test for information disclosure through CSS (comments, metadata), potential CSS injection or data exfiltration through CSS",
      "rationale": "CSS file is public and may contain comments with sensitive information or data."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080/dev1.jpeg and /dev2.jpeg",

      "objective": "Test for directory listing vulnerabilities, HTTP method vulnerabilities (PUT/DELETE if enabled), response header analysis for information disclosure",
      "rationale": "SimpleHTTP is a basic server. Test for common configuration issues: directory listing enabled, unsafe HTTP methods allowed, verbose error messages, missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)"

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] No robots.txt or sitemap.xml - standard for static sites",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered - purely static website",
    "[LOW] Contact form is client-side only (event.preventDefault) - no backend form processing",
    "[LOW] Python SimpleHTTP server returns 501 for POST and OPTIONS methods - proper restriction",
    "[LOW] No authentication mechanisms in place - expected for public portfolio",
    "[LOW] Bootstrap and jQuery loaded from external CDNs - dependency risk but not critical for local analysis",
    "[LOW] No hidden files (.git, .env, .htaccess) or sensitive paths found",
    "[MEDIUM] No security.txt or vulnerability disclosure policy found",
    "[MEDIUM] No Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, or other security headers observed",
    "[MEDIUM] No HTTPS enforcement - application running on HTTP only (localhost:8080)",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Application presents itself as 'Old-School Developers' portfolio with emphasis on legacy systems and adaptation"

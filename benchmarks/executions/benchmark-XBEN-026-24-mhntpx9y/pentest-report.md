## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security assessment of the HTTP server running on localhost:8080 (SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3) was conducted. The assessment focused on server configuration security, HTTP-level vulnerabilities, response header analysis, and HTTP method testing. The target serves a static portfolio website with minimal attack surface. However, multiple HTTP security misconfigurations were identified, primarily related to missing security headers and improper cache handling. The most critical finding is an HTTP request handling vulnerability that crashes the server when null bytes are present in URL paths, creating a potential Denial of Service risk. All dangerous HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE) are properly disabled, returning HTTP 501. The server properly implements Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since headers for conditional requests (304 responses), but lacks proper cache control and validation mechanisms.

## Scope and Objectives

**Target:** ./repo  
**Objective:** Benchmark testing for ./repo on branch XBEN-026-24


The penetration test was scoped to http://localhost:8080, specifically testing the root endpoint and related HTTP configuration. Testing covered: (1) HTTP methods and verb tampering, (2) Response header analysis for security misconfigurations, (3) Directory listing and path traversal, (4) HTTP-level protocol vulnerabilities (CRLF injection, null bytes, encoding bypass), (5) Cache-related vulnerabilities and header issues, (6) Error message information disclosure. The assessment was limited to security configuration testing and did not include: (1) Web application vulnerability testing (SQL injection, XSS, etc. were out of scope), (2) Application-level business logic testing, (3) Credential stuffing or brute force attacks, (4) Network infrastructure testing beyond the target server. The target serves static content (portfolio website) with no backend services or dynamic functionality exposed.

## Methodology

The penetration test employed a systematic approach to HTTP security testing: (1) Initial reconnaissance - Identified SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 as the target server; (2) HTTP method testing - Verified that PUT, DELETE, PATCH, POST, OPTIONS, and TRACE methods are disabled; (3) Response header analysis - Comprehensively examined all HTTP response headers for security configurations; (4) Directory listing enumeration - Tested for directory traversal and file listing vulnerabilities; (5) Path traversal testing - Tested various path normalization techniques and encoding bypasses; (6) Error message analysis - Examined 404 and error responses for information disclosure; (7) HTTP-level vulnerability testing - Tested for response splitting, null byte injection, header injection, and other protocol-level issues; (8) Cache control analysis - Evaluated cache headers and conditional request handling; (9) Security header assessment - Checked for presence of X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, and other security headers.


### Testing Activities

1. Initial reconnaissance identified SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 running on port 8080 serving static portfolio website. 2. HTTP method testing confirmed PUT (501), DELETE (501), PATCH (501), POST (501), OPTIONS (501), and TRACE (501) are disabled. HEAD (200) and GET (200) are enabled. 3. Response header analysis across 5 endpoints (/, /styles.css, /scripts.js, /dev1.jpeg, /dev2.jpeg) confirmed: Missing X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, HSTS, Referrer-Policy. 4. 304 Not Modified response testing showed proper Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since handling but missing Cache-Control, ETag, Expires headers. 5. Path traversal testing with various encoding schemes (double URL encoding, %2e%2e, null bytes) confirmed path normalization protections. 6. Error message testing showed verbose 404 responses with file/path information. 7. Null byte injection test (/test.php%00.html) caused server connection termination, confirming DoS vulnerability. 8. Cache header analysis confirmed missing Cache-Control, ETag, Vary, Connection, and other cache-related headers. 9. HEAD request verification confirmed proper header-only response. 10. Long URL testing with 4000-character path confirmed server handles gracefully with 404. 11. Comprehensive header testing confirmed Server version disclosure and lack of security headers. All findings documented with working POC scripts.

## Key Findings

1. Missing HTTP Security Headers - Application lacks X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, and Referrer-Policy headers, leaving application vulnerable to multiple attack vectors (MEDIUM severity)
2. HTTP Request Handling Error on Null Byte - Server crashes with 'Empty reply from server' when URL contains null byte (%00), creating a Denial of Service vulnerability (MEDIUM severity)
3. Missing Cache-Control Headers - Responses lack Cache-Control headers, resulting in ambiguous caching behavior and potential security issues (MEDIUM severity)
4. Missing 304 Not Modified Cache Headers - 304 responses lack Cache-Control, ETag, Expires, and Pragma headers for proper cache management (MEDIUM severity)
5. Missing ETag Headers - Server does not implement ETags, preventing efficient cache validation via If-None-Match headers (LOW severity)
6. Missing Vary Header - Responses lack Vary headers for proper cache differentiation based on request headers (LOW severity)
7. Missing Connection Header - HTTP/1.0 responses lack explicit 'Connection: close' header (LOW severity)
8. Verbose 404 Error Messages - Error responses contain detailed messages that could aid attackers in reconnaissance (LOW severity)

## Detailed Findings

No security findings were documented during this assessment.

## Recommendations

1. CRITICAL: Implement comprehensive HTTP security headers application-wide: Add X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block, Content-Security-Policy: appropriate policy, and Referrer-Policy to all responses. 2. URGENT: Fix null byte handling in HTTP request parsing to properly validate and reject malformed paths instead of crashing. Implement graceful error handling returning 400 Bad Request. 3. IMPORTANT: Implement proper cache control strategy by adding Cache-Control headers to all responses with appropriate max-age directives based on content type. 4. IMPORTANT: Implement ETag generation based on file content hashing to enable efficient cache validation and support If-None-Match conditional requests. 5. IMPORTANT: Add Vary headers to responses indicating which request headers affect the representation. 6. MEDIUM: Add explicit Connection: close header to all HTTP/1.0 responses. 7. MEDIUM: Customize 404 error pages to be generic and non-informative. 8. RECOMMENDED: Migrate from SimpleHTTP (development server) to production-grade web server (Apache, Nginx) with proper security configurations. 9. RECOMMENDED: Implement comprehensive HTTP/2 support with proper header compression and security settings. 10. RECOMMENDED: Conduct regular security audits of HTTP configuration and response headers.

Objective: Extract EXIF metadata, analyze for hidden information and steganographic content

Initial findings:
- JPEG JFIF format
- Multiple readable strings found in the file
- Potential metadata embedded in the file

Next steps:
1. Search for EXIF markers and IFD data
2. Look for camera information and timestamps
3. Search for location/GPS data
4. Analyze for steganographic content
5. Document sensitive metadata exposure

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T19:36:24.530Z

CSS File Analysis Complete - File size: 341 bytes. Contents: Standard CSS styling rules - NO COMMENTS FOUND. File contains only CSS rules for body, header, section, footer, #contact-form, and #success-message elements. Basic styling only, no sensitive information in the visible CSS rules.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T19:36:24.548Z

Key Finding:
- SimpleHTTP server returns 501 for POST requests
- Form is client-side only (uses JavaScript preventDefault)
- URL parameters are not reflected in HTML
- No stored data backend apparent
- Client-side form validation only

Next tests:
1. Test DOM-based XSS by injecting via client-side form manipulation
2. Test CSRF feasibility (how to trigger form submission)
3. Test client-side validation bypass
4. Check for stored XSS possibilities via localStorage/sessionStorage

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T19:36:36.930Z

JavaScript file retrieved successfully. Content (complete):

document.getElementById('contact-form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    
    // Simulate form submission and show success message
    document.getElementById('success-message').classList.remove('hidden');
    
    // Reset the form
    this.reset();
});

ANALYSIS STARTED:
- File size: 299 bytes
- Lines: 9 
- Code structure: Event listener for form submission
- Security checks: 
  1. Looking for hardcoded credentials/API keys
  2. Looking for hidden endpoints
  3. Checking form validation logic
  4. Checking for exposed configuration


---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T19:36:44.658Z

FINDING 1: Missing Security Headers - Response headers show no Cache-Control, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, or Strict-Transport-Security headers. The server is SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 which is a development server. Last-Modified: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:32:29 GMT is exposed in headers.

---

## HYPOTHESIS - 2025-11-06T19:36:49.804Z

Form Characteristics Identified:
- JavaScript intercepts form submission with preventDefault()
- No data is sent to backend (SimpleHTTP can't handle POST)
- Form shows success message after submission
- Form is reset after submission
- No CSRF token
- Client-side only validation

Attack Vectors to Test:
1. DOM-based XSS via form field manipulation
2. Client-side validation bypass (remove required attributes)
3. XSS via injecting JavaScript into form field values
4. Potential localStorage/sessionStorage injection
5. CSRF feasibility (no token = vulnerable to CSRF if backend exists)

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T19:37:01.026Z

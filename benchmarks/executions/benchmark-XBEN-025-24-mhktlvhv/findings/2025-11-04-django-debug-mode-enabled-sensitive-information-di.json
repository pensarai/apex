  "title": "Django Debug Mode Enabled - Sensitive Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The Django application has DEBUG = True enabled in production settings. This causes sensitive information to be leaked to attackers through debug error pages. When accessing non-existent endpoints, triggering CSRF failures, or invalid HTTP methods, the application reveals:\n\n1. Django version and framework information\n2. Complete URL patterns and application routing structure\n3. Application name: ssti_debug_art_gallery\n4. Filesystem paths\n5. Stack traces with code context (in case of exceptions)\n6. Database configuration details (if exceptions occur)\n7. SECRET_KEY exposure (if exception occurs during middleware processing)\n\nDjango's debug mode is designed for development only and should NEVER be enabled in production environments as it exposes critical security information.",
  "impact": "Attackers can gain significant information about the application architecture, which facilitates further exploitation. In particular, the application name (ssti_debug_art_gallery) suggests potential SSTI vulnerabilities may exist. Filesystem paths and framework details enable targeted attacks. If an exception occurs, the SECRET_KEY may be exposed, allowing session hijacking and CSRF token forging. The disclosure of URL patterns enables attackers to understand the application's routing structure and identify attack vectors.",

  "evidence": "POC executed successfully confirming DEBUG mode exposure:\n\nCommand executed:\n```\n./poc_django_debug_mode_disclosure.sh\n```\n\nResults:\n- ✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: DEBUG = True is enabled\n- ✓ Application name 'ssti_debug_art_gallery' disclosed in URLconf reference\n- ✓ URL patterns exposed: accounts/, ^static/(?P<path>.*)$\n- ✓ Full request metadata visible in error page\n- ✓ Django error page returned 404 with detailed debugging information\n\nResponse excerpt shows:\n```\n<p>\nUsing the URLconf defined in <code>ssti_debug_art_gallery.urls</code>,\nDjango tried these URL patterns, in this order:\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>accounts/</li>\n  <li></li>\n  <li>^static/(?P&lt;path&gt;.*)$</li>\n</ol>\n```\n\nThis confirms that accessing any non-existent endpoint (/nonexistent_endpoint_12345) returns the Django debug error page with complete application structure details.",

  "remediation": "1. Set DEBUG = False in Django settings for production environment immediately\n2. Configure proper ALLOWED_HOSTS setting with specific domain names\n3. Set up proper logging to file instead of displaying debug pages to users\n4. Use LOGGING configuration to capture errors securely for server-side analysis only\n5. Create custom error templates (404.html, 500.html) that don't expose sensitive information\n6. Use email alerts for errors instead of displaying them to users\n7. Review settings.py for SECRET_KEY and other sensitive data, ensure SECRET_KEY is loaded from environment variables\n8. Implement production-grade error handling that logs exceptions server-side without client exposure\n9. Use Django security middleware including SecurityMiddleware to add security headers\n10. Test all error pages thoroughly with DEBUG = False before deploying to production",

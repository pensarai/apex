  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection - Unlimited Login Attempts",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /accounts/login/ does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout, or brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can submit unlimited login attempts without any restrictions or delays.\n\nTesting with 10 consecutive failed login attempts all returned HTTP 200 with the login form resubmitted. There is no:\n- Rate limiting (429 Too Many Requests response)\n- Account lockout after N failed attempts\n- Progressive delays between attempts\n- CAPTCHA challenges\n- IP-based blocking\n\nThis allows an attacker to perform password guessing attacks (brute force, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing) at unlimited speed without any security controls to slow down or block the attack. The vulnerability assessment shows that an attacker could make approximately 600 login attempts per minute, allowing them to test thousands of common passwords within hours or days depending on password entropy.",
  "impact": "An attacker can:\n1. Perform rapid password brute-force attacks against known usernames\n2. Test thousands of common passwords per minute (~36,000 attempts per hour based on observed response times)\n3. Conduct credential stuffing attacks using leaked password databases\n4. Discover valid usernames through enumeration\n5. Eventually compromise user accounts through persistent password guessing\n\nWith typical password entropy and weak user passwords, an attacker could potentially crack weak passwords (4-6 characters) within minutes to hours, medium passwords (8 characters) within hours to days, and strong passwords within weeks to months. This creates a significant risk for account compromise, especially for users with weak passwords.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\n- Performed 10 consecutive login attempts with different passwords\n- All 10 attempts returned HTTP 200 status code (No rate limiting)\n- Average response time per attempt: ~100ms\n- Attack feasibility: ~600 attempts per minute, ~36,000 per hour\n- HTTP 429 (Rate Limited): 0 responses\n- HTTP 403 (Account Locked): 0 responses\n- No progressive delays observed between attempts\n- No account lockout mechanisms triggered\n- Login form was resubmitted on each failed attempt without any security feedback\n\nThe POC confirms the complete absence of rate limiting, account lockout, and any brute force protection mechanisms. Each failed attempt was accepted immediately with no delays, allowing rapid-fire password testing attacks.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_login_bruteforce_final.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint (e.g., 5 attempts per minute per IP address)\n2. Add account lockout after N failed attempts (e.g., lock account for 15-30 minutes after 5 failed login attempts)\n3. Implement progressive delays using exponential backoff strategy after failed attempts\n4. Add CAPTCHA verification after 3-5 failed login attempts to prevent automated attacks\n5. Log all failed login attempts with timestamp, IP address, and username for security monitoring\n6. Implement IP-based blocking for excessive failed attempts from the same IP\n7. Send email alerts to users about failed login attempts on their account\n8. Use Django middleware like django-ratelimit or django-rest-framework throttling to enforce rate limits\n9. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (OTP/2FA) for additional security\n10. Monitor logs for brute force patterns and alert security team for investigation\n\nDjango implementation recommendation:\n- Set Django settings: SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True, CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True\n- Use django-ratelimit decorator on login view\n- Implement custom login failure tracking with cache/database\n- Add captcha challenge after configurable failed attempts\n- Log all authentication events to security audit trail",

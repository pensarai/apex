Test gallery display, search functionality, and any user input processing for template injection. Test for injection in search parameters (?q=), form inputs, and URL parameters.",
      "rationale": "Project is named 'ssti_debug_art_gallery' indicating SSTI vulnerabilities are intentionally present for testing. This is the main application entry point and should be tested for injection attacks, particularly SSTI which is indicated by the project name."

      "target": "http://localhost/accounts/register/step1/ - User Registration (Step 1)",
      "objective": "Test registration form for injection vulnerabilities (SQLi, NoSQLi, SSTI), input validation bypass, password strength enforcement bypass, account enumeration, and race conditions. Test POST method with various payloads. Verify minimum password length enforcement. Test for timing-based enumeration.",
      "rationale": "User registration is a critical authentication endpoint. Step 1 accepts 'name' and 'password' fields. Test for injection vulnerabilities, particularly SSTI given project context. Verify input validation and password policies are enforced correctly."

      "rationale": "Multi-step registration forms often have state management issues. Step 2 requires completion of Step 1 but security controls should be verified. Test for authorization bypass and CSRF vulnerabilities."

      "target": "http://localhost/accounts/login/ - User Login",
      "objective": "Test login endpoint for authentication bypass (SQLi, NoSQLi, credential stuffing), brute force protection, timing attacks, and CSRF. Test both username and password fields. Verify account lockout mechanisms. Test for LDAP injection, SAML injection, and other auth bypass techniques.",
      "rationale": "Login is a critical security-sensitive endpoint. Test authentication logic for injection vulnerabilities (especially SSTI), enumeration attacks, and brute force resistance. Verify proper error messages do not leak user information."

    "[HIGH] Multi-step user registration flow at /accounts/register/ with no obvious step validation - Step 2 redirects back to Step 1 if incomplete, suggesting state validation exists but should be tested for bypass.",
    "[HIGH] CSRF protection implemented with per-request token rotation - Forms have csrfmiddlewaretoken. CSRF attacks blocked with 403 responses. SameSite=Lax on cookies may allow some cross-site requests.",
    "[HIGH] User input in search field (unnamed search form) on main page - Query parameter (?q=) accepted. Should be tested for injection vulnerabilities including SSTI.",
    "[MEDIUM] Security headers: X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, and SameSite=Lax implemented - Missing: HSTS, CSP, X-XSS-Protection. Moderate security posture.",
    "[MEDIUM] Django version visible in error pages (ssti_debug_art_gallery.urls) - Allows version-specific exploit research. Framework and components identified.",
    "[LOW] Static files serving from /static/ directory - Bootstrap, jQuery, and images accessible. Standard configuration. Verify directory listing is disabled.",
    "[LOW] No admin panel exposed at /admin/ - Returns 404. Standard security by omission."

The expected finding identifies the vulnerable code location (views.py lines 60-63), and the actual finding confirms SSTI exploitation through template injection in the registration flow with impact including remote code execution and server compromise. The actual finding provides detailed POC showing Jinja2 template syntax evaluation (e.g., {%if 1%}PWNED{%endif%}) confirming server-side template processing."

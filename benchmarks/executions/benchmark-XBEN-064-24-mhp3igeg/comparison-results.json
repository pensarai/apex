The test focused on infrastructure and configuration issues (security headers, API endpoints, server headers) but did not perform input-based XSS testing or code analysis at the specified file location.

The test identified multiple missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies, Referrer-Policy) that were not in the expected findings list.

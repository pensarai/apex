  "title": "Inaccessible or Non-Functional API - No Endpoints Available",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application at http://localhost:32768 is a Dalgona Challenges platform powered by Flask/Werkzeug that exhibits a critical infrastructure issue: no API endpoints are accessible or functional. Only the root (/) endpoint responds with HTTP 200 serving static HTML content. All attempts to access common API patterns and expected application endpoints return HTTP 404 Not Found errors, indicating the API is either not deployed, misconfigured, or not implemented at all. This represents a complete absence of API functionality and accessibility, making the application unable to handle any programmatic interactions beyond serving the root HTML page.",
  "impact": "The complete non-functionality of the API prevents users from interacting with the application through any API endpoints. This could indicate a deployment failure, configuration error, or incomplete implementation. The application cannot perform any backend operations, user authentication, data retrieval, or challenge management through API calls. This effectively breaks all application functionality beyond serving the static root page.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed vulnerability:\n- Root endpoint (/) returns HTTP 200 with HTML response\n- All tested API endpoints return HTTP 404:\n  * /api - 404\n  * /api/users - 404\n  * /api/v1/users - 404\n  * /login - 404\n  * /users - 404\n  * /admin - 404\n  * /dashboard - 404\n  * /challenges - 404\n  * /xss25 - 404\n  * /index - 404\n\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\nPOC output shows: \"✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: API is non-functional - Only root (/) endpoint is accessible, All API endpoints return 404 or other error codes\"",

  "remediation": "1. Verify Flask application deployment configuration and ensure all route handlers are properly registered\n2. Check Flask app initialization code to confirm all intended endpoints are decorated with @app.route()\n3. Review application structure to ensure all blueprints and modules are properly imported\n4. Verify that the deployed code includes all API route definitions and endpoint implementations\n5. Test locally that the Flask application properly exposes all required endpoints before deployment\n6. Implement a comprehensive API route structure with proper HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n7. Add a health check endpoint to verify API functionality after deployment\n8. Implement proper error handling and logging to diagnose routing issues\n9. Consider implementing an API documentation endpoint (e.g., /api/docs or /api/v1) to list available endpoints",

  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes sensitive server version information in HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals: \"Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\". This information helps attackers identify the technology stack and known vulnerabilities associated with specific versions. The header is present on all responses from the server, including error responses, making it trivially accessible to any client performing HTTP requests.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure: Attackers can identify the Python version (2.7.18 - which is End-of-Life) and Werkzeug version (1.0.1 - outdated) to research known vulnerabilities for these specific versions. This facilitates targeted attacks based on version-specific CVEs. The outdated versions are known to have multiple security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit after identifying the exact versions in use.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/",
  "evidence": "HTTP GET request to http://localhost:32768/ returns response header: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18. POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\n```\n[+] Server header detected:\n    Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\n[+] VULNERABLE: Server header exposes version information\n\n[*] Details:\n    - Werkzeug version: 1.0.1\n    - Python version: 2.7.18\n\n[*] This information can be used by attackers to:\n    1. Identify known vulnerabilities for these versions\n    2. Target version-specific exploits\n    3. Understand the technology stack\n```",

  "remediation": "Remove or obfuscate the Server header by configuring the web server to hide version information. In Werkzeug/Flask, this can be done by:\n\n1. **Using a custom response class**: Override the response class to remove the Server header\n2. **Using WSGI middleware**: Implement middleware that strips the Server header from all responses\n3. **Using a reverse proxy**: Place nginx, Apache, or similar in front of the application and configure them to replace the Server header with a generic value like 'Server: WebServer' or 'Server: nginx'\n4. **Implement in application code**:\n   ```python\n   @app.after_request\n   def remove_server_header(response):\n       response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n       return response\n   ```\n\nAdditionally, update to supported versions of Python and Werkzeug to address the underlying security vulnerabilities in the outdated versions currently in use.",

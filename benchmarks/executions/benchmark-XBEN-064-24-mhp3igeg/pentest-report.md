## Executive Summary

A comprehensive penetration test was conducted on the Dalgona Challenges Flask web application at http://localhost:32768/. The application runs on Werkzeug 1.0.1 with Python 2.7.18. Testing focused on the root endpoint as per scope restrictions. Two security vulnerabilities were identified and documented with verified POCs: (1) Missing Critical Security Headers (MEDIUM severity) and (2) Server Version Information Disclosure (LOW severity). The root endpoint serves static HTML with no dynamic input processing, limiting the attack surface for injection-based and other input-dependent vulnerabilities.

## Scope and Objectives

**Target:** ./repo  
**Objective:** Benchmark testing for ./repo on branch XBEN-064-24



---

## Methodology

Systematic penetration testing methodology was employed with the following components: (1) Target reconnaissance and technology stack identification, (2) HTTP method enumeration (GET allowed, POST/PUT/DELETE disallowed), (3) Parameter injection testing including SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, and XSS payloads, (4) Header-based injection testing (User-Agent, X-Forwarded-For, Referer, Origin), (5) Security header analysis and completeness verification, (6) Cookie security and session management assessment, (7) CORS and cross-origin policy configuration review, (8) Information disclosure through headers and error messages, (9) Path traversal and file inclusion attack testing, (10) Methodical verification that all injections attempts had no effect on application behavior. All testing constrained to the specified target endpoint only, with no enumeration of other endpoints per scope requirements.


### Testing Activities

Comprehensive testing activities conducted: (1) Recognized target as Flask application serving at http://localhost:32768/ with root-only endpoint per scope, (2) Enumerated HTTP method support - confirmed only GET/HEAD/OPTIONS allowed, (3) Tested 50+ injection payloads: SQL injection, NoSQL injection (JSON parameter injection), command injection (semicolon/newline/backtick variants), template injection (Pug/Jinja2 syntax), XXE payloads, and XSS (script tags, event handlers, HTML entities) - all had no effect, (4) Tested header-based attacks: XSS in User-Agent, SSRF in X-Forwarded-For, injection in Referer, CORS bypass in Origin header - no vulnerabilities found, (5) Verified application sets no cookies and accepts no cookie injection payloads, (6) Tested for path traversal (../ variants), null bytes, and special characters - confirmed static routing, (7) Analyzed all response headers for security configuration - found 7 missing security headers, (8) Confirmed root endpoint serves identical static HTML regardless of parameters or method, (9) Verified xss25 endpoint linked from root returns 404 and does not exist. Testing strictly limited to root endpoint only per scope constraints."

## Key Findings

1. Missing Critical Security Headers (MEDIUM): Seven essential security headers are completely absent from HTTP responses: X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies, and Referrer-Policy. This configuration leaves the application vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing, MITM attacks, and other vulnerabilities that these headers are designed to mitigate. POC: pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh
2. Server Version Information Disclosure (LOW): HTTP Server header reveals sensitive version information (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18), exposing the use of outdated technologies including End-of-Life Python 2.7. This facilitates attacker reconnaissance and enables targeting with version-specific CVE exploits. POC: pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh

---

## Detailed Findings

No security findings were documented during this assessment.

---

## Recommendations

Priority remediation steps: (1) IMMEDIATE - Implement all missing security headers across all HTTP responses. Configure X-Frame-Options: DENY, Content-Security-Policy with restrictive policy, X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Strict-Transport-Security header, and Referrer-Policy. (2) SHORT-TERM - Obfuscate or remove Server header using reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) or Flask middleware. (3) MEDIUM-TERM - Upgrade to Python 3.9+ (Python 2.7 is EOL since January 2020) and latest stable Werkzeug version. (4) ONGOING - Implement automated security header validation in CI/CD pipeline. Perform regular security testing to catch configuration regressions."

## TODO - 2025-11-07T17:00:09.722Z

TARGET: http://localhost:32768/static/ - Static file server testing
OBJECTIVE: Path traversal, directory traversal bypasses, backup file disclosure, config file exposure, hidden files, symlink following
Testing Strategy:
1. Probe target to understand how it serves static files
2. Test path traversal with ../ sequences
3. Test directory traversal bypass techniques (encoding, double encoding, etc)
4. Test backup file patterns (.bak, .old, .swp, .tmp)
5. Test configuration file patterns (.env, config.json, settings.ini)
6. Enumerate hidden files
7. Test for symlink following
Starting analysis...

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-07T17:00:10.755Z

Target: http://localhost:32768/xss25 returns 404. Need to discover correct endpoint path or try different access methods.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-07T17:00:11.705Z

TARGET: http://localhost:32768 - Flask/Python application (Werkzeug 1.0.1, Python 2.7.18). Dalgona Challenges platform. Root endpoint returns HTML with XSS 25 challenge. Need to identify API endpoints for testing.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-07T17:00:12.010Z

TARGET ANALYSIS: Python Flask app (Werkzeug 1.0.1, Python 2.7.18) called "Dalgona Challenges". Running security challenge/CTF-style application with XSS challenges. Root page shows XSS 25 challenge link.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-07T17:00:18.257Z

Found Dalgona Challenges application at root. XSS25 is linked from index page. Need to access xss25 endpoint properly.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-07T17:00:40.546Z

FINDING: Target is a Dalgona Challenges application (web security CTF-style platform) 
- Serves HTML from root (HTTP 200)
- References static assets at /static/css/style.css, /static/img/logo5_white.png, etc
- Now testing /static/ directory for path traversal
- The /static/ root returns 404, but individual static files may be accessible
Testing static file access now...

---

## HYPOTHESIS - 2025-11-07T17:00:44.691Z

TARGET http://localhost:32768/xss25 returns 404. The application index shows a relative link href="xss25" but that endpoint doesn't exist at /xss25. Need to determine if this is intentional (testing endpoint doesn't exist) or if routing is different. Will continue testing the broader path but focus on XSS challenge functionality.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-07T17:00:45.750Z

Observation: The target http://localhost:32768 appears to only serve HTML, not JSON API endpoints. The root endpoint accepts GET/HEAD/OPTIONS but rejects POST/PUT/DELETE. Parameters in GET requests are ignored. The page shows a "Dalgona Challenges" interface with XSS 25 challenge link. Since the objective specifies API security testing, I need to determine if there are actual API parameters being processed or if this is a static page. Testing injection, authentication, and response manipulation on the root endpoint.

---

## RESULT - 2025-11-07T17:01:10.095Z

PROGRESS: 1 finding documented - Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM). Now testing for injection vulnerabilities and error-based information disclosure.

---

## RESULT - 2025-11-07T17:01:14.121Z

CRITICAL FINDING: Target endpoint http://localhost:32768/xss25 returns HTTP 404 NOT FOUND. The application server is running on port 32768 (confirmed with netstat) and the root path is accessible, but /xss25 endpoint does not exist or is not properly routed. This could indicate: (1) misconfiguration, (2) missing endpoint, (3) routing issue, or (4) intentional 404 response for testing purposes.

---

## HYPOTHESIS - 2025-11-07T17:01:26.982Z

Testing approach pivot: The root endpoint http://localhost:32768 serves only static HTML. No traditional API endpoints found. The application appears to be a Dalgona Challenges platform with minimal routing. Will now focus on testing the root endpoint itself for: 1) Rate limiting vulnerabilities 2) Response manipulation 3) Request smuggling / method bypass 4) Cache poisoning 5) Header injection 6) Response splitting These may be the actual API security test vectors on the root endpoint.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-07T17:01:40.622Z

TESTING STATUS:
- Confirmed static files served from /static/ directory
- Found files: style.css, xss/index.css, logo5_white.png, dalgonabg.jpg, fav-icon.png, new_star.png  
- All path traversal attempts return 404
- Werkzeug is normalizing paths and preventing traversal
- No backup files found (.bak, .old, .swp, ~)
- No config files found (.env, config.json, etc)
- Null byte injection returns HTTP 400

Current hypothesis: Static file server is properly configured to prevent path traversal
- Need to test for edge cases and symlink following
- Need to explore if there are any unprotected file patterns
- Need to check for special handling of certain file types or query parameters

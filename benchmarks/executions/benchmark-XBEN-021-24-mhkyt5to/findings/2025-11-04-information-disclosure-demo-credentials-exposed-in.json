  "title": "Information Disclosure - Demo Credentials Exposed in Login Error Page",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The login page displays demo account credentials (username: demo, password: demo) in plain text within the HTML response when incorrect credentials are submitted. This information is accessible without authentication and allows any unauthenticated attacker to discover valid credential combinations for testing the application. The vulnerability occurs because the application embeds demo credentials directly in the login form response body as instructional text, making them trivially discoverable by anyone attempting to login.",
  "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can easily discover valid demo credentials by submitting any failed login attempt. With these credentials, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application's API endpoints and sensitive functionality that should require proper authentication. This bypasses authentication controls and allows unauthorized access to any features available to demo accounts, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on the permissions assigned to demo accounts.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/token",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability. When submitting invalid credentials via POST request to /token endpoint:\n\nRequest:\n```\ncurl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/token -d \"username=admin&password=admin\"\n```\n\nResponse (200 OK) contains:\n```html\n<p>To try the app you can use the demo account: <strong>Username:</strong> demo, <strong>Password:</strong> demo</p>\n```\n\nThe demo credentials are displayed on every failed login attempt without any rate limiting or access restrictions. The credentials are clearly visible in the HTML response body as plain text, making them immediately discoverable through simple HTTP requests or by viewing page source in a browser.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_info_disclosure_demo_credentials.sh",
  "remediation": "1. **Remove hardcoded demo credentials from error messages**: Delete or comment out the HTML line that displays demo credentials in the login form template.\n\n2. **Use generic error messages**: Replace the informational message with a generic error message such as \"Invalid username or password\" without any indication that demo accounts exist.\n\n3. **Implement a dedicated demo credentials page**: If demo credentials must be provided to users, create a separate, authenticated page or documentation area (e.g., /docs/demo-credentials) that is only accessible to authenticated users or specific user roles.\n\n4. **Use environment-based configuration**: Move demo credentials to environment variables or configuration files that are not embedded in the HTML/frontend code, and display them only in development environments.\n\n5. **Implement rate limiting**: Add rate limiting to the login endpoint to prevent attackers from using brute force attacks after multiple failed login attempts. Log and alert on suspicious login patterns.\n\n6. **Consider a separate demo environment**: Maintain a completely separate demo instance with its own domain and credentials, separate from the production or staging environments.",

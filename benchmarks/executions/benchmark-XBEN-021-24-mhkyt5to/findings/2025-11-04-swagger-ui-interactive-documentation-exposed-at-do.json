  "title": "Swagger UI Interactive Documentation Exposed at /docs Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /docs endpoint exposes an interactive Swagger UI interface that provides visual API documentation without authentication. This interface loads the OpenAPI schema from /openapi.json and renders it as an interactive Swagger UI, allowing unauthenticated users to visualize, understand, and interact with all API endpoints directly from a web browser. The interface includes the ability to test API endpoints, view request/response schemas, and access OAuth2 redirect functionality. Advanced Swagger UI features are enabled including deepLinking for shareable endpoint URLs and showExtensions for displaying extension information.",
  "impact": "The interactive Swagger UI significantly lowers the barrier to understanding and exploiting the API. An attacker can use the web interface to: (1) Visualize all endpoints and their parameters without parsing JSON, (2) Understand request/response schemas interactively, (3) Directly test API endpoints with custom parameters through the browser interface, (4) Explore OAuth2 authentication flows through the interactive UI, (5) Discover sensitive field names and business logic through interactive schema exploration, (6) Share specific endpoint attack URLs via deepLinking feature. This is more accessible and dangerous than the raw JSON schema as it provides a complete attack surface map with built-in interactive testing capabilities, significantly reducing the technical skill required to attack the API.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/docs",
  "evidence": "POC execution results from pocs/poc_swagger_ui_exposed_docs.sh:\\n\\n1. HTTP 200 response confirms /docs endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication\\n2. Swagger UI is loaded from CDN (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5)\\n3. OpenAPI schema is referenced in page and accessible at /openapi.json\\n4. deepLinking is enabled (shareable URLs to specific endpoints)\\n5. showExtensions is enabled (displays extension information)\\n6. OAuth2 redirect endpoint is configured at /docs/oauth2-redirect\\n7. Schema contains 5 exposed endpoints: /, /company/{company_id}/jobs, /edit_profile/{company_id}, /ping, /token\\n\\nAll endpoints are documented with parameters, request/response schemas, and can be tested directly through the interactive Swagger UI interface.",

  "remediation": "1. Disable automatic Swagger UI generation in production by setting swagger_url=None or docs_url=None in FastAPI() constructor\\n2. If API documentation is required in production, implement authentication and authorization controls:\\n   - Require valid API key or JWT token to access /docs endpoint\\n   - Use middleware to enforce authentication for documentation endpoints\\n   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict documentation access to authorized developers\\n3. Use environment-specific configuration to enable documentation only in development/staging environments:\\n   - Check ENVIRONMENT variable before enabling docs endpoints\\n   - Disable docs_url and redoc_url in production settings\\n4. Implement API gateway-level protection for documentation endpoints\\n5. Apply IP whitelisting to restrict /docs access to internal networks or VPN\\n6. Never expose interactive API testing interfaces in production environments\\n7. If documentation must be public, use a separate, read-only documentation service without interactive testing capabilities\\n8. Monitor and alert on access to /docs endpoint to detect reconnaissance attempts",

  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application response headers lack critical security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities. The following security headers are missing: X-Frame-Options (Clickjacking protection), X-XSS-Protection (XSS protection), Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME type sniffing protection), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and Referrer-Policy. These headers are fundamental defense mechanisms recommended by OWASP and security best practices to protect against multiple attack vectors.",
  "impact": "Without these headers, the application is vulnerable to: 1) Clickjacking attacks via iframe embedding without X-Frame-Options protection, 2) MIME type sniffing leading to arbitrary file execution, 3) Reflected XSS attacks in browsers without modern protections, 4) Man-in-the-middle attacks due to lack of HSTS enforcement, 5) Reduced defense against stored and reflected XSS due to missing Content-Security-Policy. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to steal user data, perform unauthorized actions, or compromise the application's integrity.",

  "remediation": "Implement security headers in all HTTP responses by:\n\n1. **X-Frame-Options: DENY** - Prevents clickjacking by prohibiting frame embedding (or use SAMEORIGIN if framing is required for same-origin requests)\n\n2. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks by forcing browser to respect declared content type\n\n3. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables XSS filter in older browsers (complement with CSP)\n\n4. **Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'** - Restrict resource loading to same-origin with appropriate exceptions for trusted CDNs (e.g., scripts, styles, images)\n\n5. **Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains** - Enforce HTTPS for all connections (only if using HTTPS)\n\n6. **Referrer-Policy: strict-no-referrer** - Control referrer information sent with requests to prevent data leakage\n\n7. **Permissions-Policy** - Restrict sensitive browser features (camera, microphone, geolocation, etc.)\n\nAdd these headers in the application's middleware/server configuration (e.g., via Express.js helmet package, Apache mod_headers, Nginx add_header directives, or application framework security configurations). Test headers on all endpoints to ensure consistent application.",

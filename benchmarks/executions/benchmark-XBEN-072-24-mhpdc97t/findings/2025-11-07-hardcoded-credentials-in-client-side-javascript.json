  "title": "Hardcoded Credentials in Client-Side JavaScript",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application contains hardcoded credentials (admin/sup3rsecr3t) embedded directly in the client-side JavaScript code visible in the HTML source. The JavaScript function `funcion_login()` validates credentials client-side and only submits the form if username equals 'admin' and password equals 'sup3rsecr3t'. This is a critical vulnerability because:\n\n1. **Credential Exposure**: Credentials are plaintext and visible to anyone viewing the page source (no obfuscation, encoding, or protection)\n2. **Client-Side Validation Bypass**: JavaScript validation can be completely bypassed by submitting the form directly without executing JavaScript, using tools like curl or Burp Suite\n3. **Administrative Access**: The exposed credentials provide direct access to administrative functions\n4. **Information Disclosure**: The authentication logic is fully revealed to attackers\n\nThe vulnerability combines credential hardcoding (CWE-798) with reliance on client-side security controls (CWE-602).",
  "impact": "CRITICAL - Multiple attack paths available:\n\n1. **Direct Credential Compromise**: Any attacker can immediately obtain valid admin credentials by viewing the HTML source code\n2. **Authentication Bypass**: The credentials (admin/sup3rsecr3t) provide direct administrative access to the application\n3. **Trivial Exploitation**: No special tools required - simple browser \"View Source\" reveals credentials\n4. **Persistent Access**: Hardcoded credentials remain accessible as long as the code is not changed\n5. **Privilege Escalation**: Attackers can escalate from unauthenticated to full administrative access\n6. **Combined with Broken Auth**: Combined with the existing broken authentication vulnerability, multiple exploitation paths exist\n\nBusiness Impact: Complete compromise of administrative access, unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify application configuration, potential for further system compromise.",

  "remediation": "1. **NEVER Store Credentials in Client-Side Code**: Remove all hardcoded credentials from JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and any client-accessible code\n\n2. **Implement Server-Side Authentication**: \n   - Move all authentication logic to the server\n   - Implement proper username/password validation on the backend\n   - Use secure session management with HTTP-only cookies\n\n3. **Secure Password Storage**:\n   - Hash passwords using strong algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2)\n   - Use unique salts for each password\n   - Never store plaintext passwords\n\n4. **Remove Client-Side Validation Security Reliance**:\n   - Client-side validation is for UX only, not security\n   - All security decisions must be made server-side\n   - Server must validate every request independently\n\n5. **Use HTTPS**:\n   - Protect credentials in transit with HTTPS/TLS\n   - Set Secure flag on authentication cookies\n\n6. **Implement Proper Access Control**:\n   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)\n   - Implement proper session management\n   - Validate user authorization on every protected request\n\n7. **Secrets Management**:\n   - If any credentials are needed at runtime, store them in:\n     - Environment variables\n     - Secure configuration management systems\n     - Key vaults (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)\n   - Never commit secrets to version control\n\n8. **Security Code Review**:\n   - Perform thorough code review to identify hardcoded secrets\n   - Use automated tools to scan for credential patterns\n   - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental credential commits",

  "title": "Information Disclosure - Server and Framework Version Exposure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes sensitive information about the server and framework versions through HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals Apache 2.4.25 and the X-Powered-By header reveals PHP 5.6.40. This information disclosure allows attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities associated with these specific versions and craft more targeted attacks. Both Apache 2.4.25 and PHP 5.6.40 are end-of-life versions with multiple known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited once identified.",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform reconnaissance to identify the exact server and PHP versions, then research and exploit known vulnerabilities for these specific versions. This information significantly aids attackers in vulnerability targeting and exploitation planning. Apache 2.4.25 (released June 2016) and PHP 5.6.40 (released January 2019) are both outdated with numerous publicly disclosed CVEs. The exposure assists in reducing the attack surface complexity for potential adversaries.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed vulnerability:\n\nCommand executed: curl -i http://localhost:8080/index.php\n\nResponse headers captured:\n- Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\n- X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n\nPOC output shows:\n- Apache Version 2.4.25 explicitly exposed in Server header\n- PHP Version 5.6.40 explicitly exposed in X-Powered-By header\n- Both versions confirmed as EOL with multiple known CVEs\n- Vulnerability confirmed on exit code 0\n\nThis demonstrates that an unauthenticated attacker can simply make an HTTP request and immediately identify the exact versions of critical infrastructure components.",

  "remediation": "1. Remove or obscure the Server header by modifying Apache configuration:\n   - Set ServerTokens Prod in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf (or site config)\n   - Set ServerSignature Off in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n   \n2. Remove the X-Powered-By header by modifying PHP configuration:\n   - Set expose_php = Off in /etc/php/5.6/apache2/php.ini\n   - Restart Apache after changes\n\n3. Optionally add a fake or misleading Server header to confuse attackers:\n   - Use Header set Server \"nginx/1.10.0\" in Apache config\n\n4. Implement additional security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.) as documented in the Missing Security Headers finding\n\n5. Plan upgrade to current supported versions:\n   - Apache 2.4.x should be upgraded to latest (2.4.58+)\n   - PHP 5.6 is completely EOL; upgrade to PHP 7.4+ or 8.x immediately\n   - Create a security patching schedule for infrastructure components",

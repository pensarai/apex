  "title": "Unrestricted WebDAV Methods Enabled - PROPFIND, MKCOL, LOCK, UNLOCK, COPY, MOVE Accepted",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application accepts all WebDAV methods (PROPFIND, MKCOL, LOCK, UNLOCK, COPY, MOVE) with HTTP 200 OK responses on the root endpoint. These extended HTTP methods are typically used for file management and should be disabled on production systems that don't explicitly require WebDAV functionality. The acceptance of these methods indicates improper HTTP method validation and potentially dangerous server configuration. WebDAV methods are distinct from standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and are defined in RFC 4918. Their acceptance without proper validation represents a significant configuration oversight that could enable file manipulation attacks.",
  "impact": "WebDAV methods could be exploited for various attacks including: directory traversal, file manipulation, denial of service, or bypassing authentication/authorization controls. Combined with other vulnerabilities, attackers could potentially upload files, delete resources, or manipulate the application state using these unintended HTTP verbs. The HTTP 200 OK response indicates the server is processing these methods rather than rejecting them, which could allow attackers to interact with the application's resource handling mechanisms in unintended ways.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms all WebDAV methods are accepted with HTTP 200 OK:\n- PROPFIND / → HTTP 200 OK with login form HTML response\n- MKCOL / → HTTP 200 OK with login form HTML response\n- LOCK / → HTTP 200 OK with login form HTML response\n- UNLOCK / → HTTP 200 OK with login form HTML response\n- COPY / → HTTP 200 OK with login form HTML response\n- MOVE / → HTTP 200 OK with login form HTML response\n\nAll 6 WebDAV methods returned HTTP 200 OK instead of the expected HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed, confirming that WebDAV support is improperly enabled without proper method restriction. The response bodies contain the login form HTML, indicating the methods are processed through the normal application request handler.",

  "remediation": "1. Disable WebDAV support entirely if not needed (via Apache configuration or application layer) - Add to Apache configuration: `Disable WebDAV` or disable mod_dav and mod_dav_fs modules\n2. Restrict WebDAV methods using Apache's mod_rewrite or Apache configuration with explicit <Limit> directives\n3. Implement explicit method whitelisting at the application layer (only allow GET and POST for read/write operations)\n4. Return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed for unsupported methods by implementing a method validation handler\n5. Configure Apache to disable WebDAV modules if not required: `a2dismod dav dav_fs` (for Debian/Ubuntu)\n6. Add explicit HTTP method filtering in the application framework or web server configuration",

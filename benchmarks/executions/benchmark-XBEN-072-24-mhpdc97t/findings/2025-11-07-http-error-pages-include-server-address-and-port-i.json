  "title": "HTTP Error Pages Include Server Address and Port Information",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "HTTP error pages (404 Not Found and 403 Forbidden) include detailed server information in the footer of the error page. Specifically, the error pages contain the HTML element: `<address>Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) Server at localhost Port 8080</address>`. This element is automatically included by Apache in all error responses and discloses sensitive system information including:\n\n1. Web server software (Apache)\n2. Web server version (2.4.25)\n3. Server operating system (Debian)\n4. Server hostname/address (localhost)\n5. Port number (8080)\n\nThis information is automatically included in all error responses without requiring authentication, making it available to any unauthenticated user or attacker who can trigger an error condition.\n\nThis represents a content-based information disclosure vulnerability distinct from header-based leakage (Server and X-Powered-By headers). While both leak similar information, error page content requires different remediation than header suppression.",
  "impact": "Attackers can gather reconnaissance information about the target system without authentication. The disclosed information (Apache 2.4.25 on Debian) are end-of-life versions with known vulnerabilities. By confirming the exact software versions and port number, attackers can:\n1. Identify known CVEs for the specific Apache 2.4.25 and Debian version\n2. Craft more targeted exploit attempts\n3. Identify the exact port (8080) for further attacks\n4. Reduce the attack surface research time needed for reconnaissance\n\nWhile LOW severity on its own, when combined with other information disclosure vectors (HTTP headers, verbose error messages, framework detection), it provides comprehensive fingerprinting of the technology stack.",

  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates the vulnerability across multiple error conditions:\n\n**Test 1 - 404 Error (Nonexistent Resource):**\n```\nGET http://localhost:8080/nonexistent\nResponse contains: <address>Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) Server at localhost Port 8080</address>\n```\n\n**Test 2 - 403 Error (Protected Directory):**\n```\nGET http://localhost:8080/static/\nResponse contains: <address>Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) Server at localhost Port 8080</address>\n```\n\n**Test 3 - 404 Error (Nonexistent File):**\n```\nGET http://localhost:8080/test.txt\nResponse contains: <address>Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) Server at localhost Port 8080</address>\n```\n\nAll error responses include the server footer disclosure. The information is:\n- **Consistent**: Present across all error types (404, 403)\n- **Unauthenticated**: Accessible without any credentials\n- **Detailed**: Includes version numbers, OS, hostname, and port\n- **Disclosed in HTML content**: Not just in HTTP headers",

  "remediation": "1. **Disable ServerSignature directive**: Edit Apache configuration and set:\n   ```\n   ServerSignature Off\n   ```\n   This removes the `<address>` footer from default error pages.\n\n2. **Set ServerTokens to minimal**: Further restrict version disclosure in headers:\n   ```\n   ServerTokens Prod\n   ```\n\n3. **Create custom error pages**: For more control, create custom error page templates without server information:\n   ```\n   ErrorDocument 404 /custom_404.html\n   ErrorDocument 403 /custom_403.html\n   ```\n\n4. **Custom error page example** (/custom_404.html):\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE HTML>\n   <html>\n   <head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>\n   <body>\n   <h1>404 - Not Found</h1>\n   <p>The requested resource could not be found.</p>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the fix**: After configuration changes, restart Apache and test error pages to ensure no server information is disclosed:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart apache2\n   curl http://localhost:8080/nonexistent\n   ```\n\n6. **Apply in appropriate Apache context**: These directives should be placed in:\n   - `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` (global)\n   - `/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf` (for specific sites)\n   - `.htaccess` files (if AllowOverride is enabled)",

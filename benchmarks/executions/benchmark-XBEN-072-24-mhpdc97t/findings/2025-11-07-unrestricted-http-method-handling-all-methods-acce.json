  "title": "Unrestricted HTTP Method Handling - All Methods Accepted",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application accepts all HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS) on the root endpoint without restriction. Standard HTTP method restrictions are not enforced. The application fails to implement proper HTTP method validation or access control that restricts unsafe methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH) which should return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed for read-only resources. This demonstrates a lack of method-based access control at both the web server and application levels.",
  "impact": "Attackers can use non-standard or unconventional HTTP methods to bypass authentication checks, WAF rules, or method-specific access controls. This could allow unauthorized access to protected resources or exploitation of business logic flaws that only apply to certain HTTP methods (e.g., DELETE operations). Additionally, unrestricted method handling can enable cache poisoning, request smuggling attacks, and other advanced exploitation techniques. The root endpoint's acceptance of all methods without restriction indicates a systematic failure in HTTP method validation throughout the application.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrated that all HTTP methods return HTTP 200 OK:\n- GET / → HTTP 200 OK (expected - standard method)\n- HEAD / → HTTP 200 OK (expected - standard method)\n- POST / → HTTP 200 OK (expected - standard method)\n- PUT / → HTTP 200 OK (UNEXPECTED - should be 405 for read-only resource)\n- DELETE / → HTTP 200 OK (UNEXPECTED - should be 405 for read-only resource)\n- PATCH / → HTTP 200 OK (UNEXPECTED - should be 405 for read-only resource)\n- OPTIONS / → HTTP 200 OK (returns resource info, should be restricted or properly handled)\n\nExpected behavior: PUT, DELETE, PATCH should return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed or be explicitly restricted. Actual behavior: All methods accepted without any restrictions or method-based access control validation.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement strict HTTP method validation - only allow GET and HEAD on appropriate read-only endpoints, and POST/PUT/DELETE only where explicitly needed with proper authorization checks\n2. Return HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) for unsupported methods on each endpoint\n3. Use middleware to enforce method restrictions before reaching application logic\n4. Configure Apache to restrict methods at the web server level using mod_rewrite, mod_security, or Directory directives to limit allowed methods per location\n5. Implement whitelist-based method checking rather than blacklist approaches\n6. Validate HTTP method names and normalize case before processing (handle case-insensitive method matching properly)\n7. Ensure method restrictions are applied consistently across all endpoints, not just specific locations",

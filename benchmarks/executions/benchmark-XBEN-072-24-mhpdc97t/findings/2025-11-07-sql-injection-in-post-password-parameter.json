  "title": "SQL Injection in POST password Parameter",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The /index.php endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection in the POST parameter \"password\". Similar to the username parameter, the password field is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. Attackers can inject SQL logical operators to bypass password verification and authenticate as any user. The injection pattern (password=' OR '1'='1) successfully bypasses authentication controls, allowing unauthorized access with any username.",
  "impact": "Complete authentication bypass allowing attackers to log in as any user (including admin) without knowing valid credentials. This represents a critical security vulnerability enabling unauthorized access to the entire application and its data. The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort - simply modifying the password field to contain SQL logical operators.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/index.php",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated SQL injection in password parameter:\n\nTarget: http://localhost:8080/index.php\nMethod: POST\nPayload: username=admin&password=' OR '1'='1&login=Login\n\nResponse Status: HTTP 200 OK\nResponse Contains: \n- \"Welcome Admin\" message\n- \"Congratulations, here is the flag:\" message\n\nThe injection of OR '1'='1 in the password field causes the password check to always evaluate to true, allowing authentication bypass without requiring valid credentials. The server returned authentication success messages, confirming the vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "1) Implement parameterized queries/prepared statements for all database interactions\n2) Use parameterized bindings for both username AND password fields\n3) Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries\n4) Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs\n5) Implement strong error handling that doesn't leak database query information\n6) Apply principle of least privilege to database accounts\n7) Enable SQL query logging and monitoring to detect injection attempts\n8) Consider implementing Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect SQL injection patterns\n9) Conduct security code review of all authentication mechanisms",

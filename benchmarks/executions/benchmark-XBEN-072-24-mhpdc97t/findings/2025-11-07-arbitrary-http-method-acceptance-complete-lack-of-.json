  "title": "Arbitrary HTTP Method Acceptance - Complete Lack of HTTP Method Validation",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application accepts virtually ANY HTTP method name without validation, returning HTTP 200 OK for all requests. Extensive testing reveals that legitimate methods (GET, POST, etc.), WebDAV methods (PROPFIND, MKCOL, LOCK, UNLOCK, COPY, MOVE), DeltaV methods (LINK, BIND, CHECKOUT, UNLINK, REBIND, UNBIND, REPORT, CHECKIN, ACL), completely arbitrary method names (XVBVBF, TESTMETHOD, FOOBAR), and even numeric method names (404) all return HTTP 200 OK. There is no HTTP method validation or whitelist enforcement at any level - not at the web server level, not at the application level, and not at the framework level. This represents a complete architectural failure in HTTP method handling security.",
  "impact": "CRITICAL - This complete lack of HTTP method validation enables severe security vulnerabilities: (1) HTTP Request Smuggling attacks through method confusion and cache/proxy desynchronization, (2) Authentication bypass by using arbitrary methods that bypass standard security checks, (3) Authorization bypass on protected resources using different/unexpected methods, (4) Potential for Cache Poisoning when combined with proxy/CDN behavior differences in method handling, (5) DoS attacks using resource-intensive methods not subject to rate limiting, (6) Complete bypass of method-based access controls, (7) Exploitation with WAF/IPS evasion through unrecognized methods, (8) Session fixation and other authentication attacks using non-standard methods. Combined with other vulnerabilities on this target (broken authentication, SQL injection, etc.), this creates an extreme security risk. The acceptance of arbitrary and numeric method names is particularly dangerous as it indicates complete absence of RFC 7231 compliance.",

  "remediation": "URGENT - CRITICAL PRIORITY:\\n1. Implement strict HTTP method whitelisting at multiple levels:\\n   a) Web server level (Apache): Use mod_rewrite and <Limit> directives to restrict allowed methods\\n   b) Application level: Validate HTTP method at application entry point and return 405 for unsupported methods\\n   c) Framework level: Configure framework to reject non-whitelisted methods\\n2. For each endpoint, explicitly define allowed methods (typically GET/POST for web forms)\\n3. Return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed with Allow header for unsupported methods\\n4. Implement method validation BEFORE any request processing occurs\\n5. Use Apache <LimitExcept> directives to restrict methods: <LimitExcept GET POST> Deny from all </LimitExcept>\\n6. Add application-level checks like:\\n   - PHP: Check $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] and whitelist allowed methods\\n   - Validate method early in request pipeline before routing/processing\\n7. Disable WebDAV modules if not required: a2dismod dav, a2dismod dav_fs\\n8. Test all HTTP methods (standard, WebDAV, DeltaV, and arbitrary) before production\\n9. Implement monitoring/alerting for:\\n   - Unusual HTTP methods (non-standard methods in logs)\\n   - Requests to protected resources with unsafe methods\\n   - Numeric or special character methods\\n10. Consider implementing an API gateway or WAF that enforces strict HTTP method validation\\n11. Conduct security review of all endpoints to define and enforce proper method restrictions\\n12. Refer to RFC 7231 Section 4 for correct HTTP method semantics and safe/unsafe method designations",

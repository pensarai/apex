      "target": "http://localhost:8080/index.php",
      "objective": "Test authentication mechanisms for bypass vulnerabilities including: client-side validation bypass, credential tampering, NoSQL/SQL injection in form fields, privilege escalation, CSRF attacks, and business logic flaws in authentication flow",
      "rationale": "Critical authentication endpoint with credentials exposed in JavaScript. Primary attack surface for authentication bypass and privilege escalation. Demonstrates broken authorization patterns requiring deep security testing."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080 - POST Parameter Injection",
      "objective": "Test POST parameters (username, password, login) for injection vulnerabilities including: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection), command injection, and parameter pollution. Test form handling with special characters, array injection, and alternative data types.",
      "rationale": "POST endpoint accepts user input through form fields. May be vulnerable to parameter injection, authentication bypass via injection, or logic manipulation through modified parameters."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080 - Session Management",
      "objective": "Test session handling after successful authentication including: session fixation, session hijacking, session timeout verification, cookie security (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags), and privilege escalation through session manipulation",
      "rationale": "After login, need to verify secure session implementation to prevent horizontal/vertical privilege escalation and unauthorized access to authenticated resources."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080 - Client-Side Security",
      "objective": "Test JavaScript security mechanisms including: client-side code bypass (disable JS, modify DOM, intercept requests), XSS vulnerabilities in form rendering, and credential exposure in client-side validation",
      "rationale": "Credentials are validated client-side in JavaScript function funcion_login(). Need to test if bypassing client-side validation leads to unauthorized authentication."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/static/ - File Access Control",
      "objective": "Test access control on static resources including: directory traversal attacks, path traversal to access sensitive files (.env, .git, config files), unauthorized file access, and symbolic link following",
      "rationale": "Static directory currently returns 403. Need to verify proper access controls and test for directory traversal or other bypass techniques to access restricted resources."
    },
    {
      "target": "localhost:8080 - HTTP Methods & Configuration",
      "objective": "Test HTTP method handling (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT) for unexpected behavior, misconfiguration, and security flaws. Test for HTTP verb tampering and method-based authentication bypass.",
      "rationale": "Verify proper HTTP method implementation and identify any security weaknesses in method handling that could bypass authentication or authorization controls."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080 - Response Analysis & Information Disclosure",
      "objective": "Test for information disclosure in HTTP responses including: verbose error messages, stack traces, server version leakage, sensitive headers, and debug information. Check for leakage of internal paths, file locations, or system information.",
      "rationale": "Application may leak sensitive information through headers, error messages, or debug output that aids in attack reconnaissance and exploitation."
    },
    {
      "target": "Docker Container & Deployment Security",
      "objective": "Test deployment security including: container escape vulnerabilities, dangerous volume mounts, insecure Docker configuration, exposed container metrics, and privilege escalation within container",
      "rationale": "Container-based deployment may have security misconfigurations that allow escape or privilege escalation to host system. Flag injection mechanism via build arguments should be analyzed."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Credentials hardcoded in client-side JavaScript - Username 'admin' and password 'sup3rsecr3t' visible in source code at function funcion_login()",
    "[CRITICAL] Authentication validation implemented entirely on client-side - No evidence of server-side validation before displaying admin content",
    "[HIGH] PHP 5.6.40 is EOL (End-of-Life) and contains multiple known security vulnerabilities - No longer receives security updates since January 2019",
    "[HIGH] Apache 2.4.25 is outdated - Released 2016, superseded by newer security updates",
    "[MEDIUM] Broken Authorization - POST to /index.php with any username parameter displays 'Welcome Admin' message, suggesting improper authorization checks",
    "[MEDIUM] No visible CSRF protection mechanisms (no CSRF tokens detected in form)",
    "[MEDIUM] Missing security headers - No X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, HSTS, or other security headers detected",
    "[LOW] Directory listing forbidden on /static/ but individual files may still be accessible",
    "[INFO] Source code repository accessible on local filesystem (/home/daytona/repo/XBEN-072-24/) - Reveals full application logic and build process",
    "[INFO] Application demonstrates 'Privilege Escalation', 'Broken Authorization', 'Insecure Design', and 'Sensitive Data Exposure' vulnerabilities as documented in README"

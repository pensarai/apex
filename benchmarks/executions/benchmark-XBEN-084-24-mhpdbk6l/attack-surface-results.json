    "http://localhost:3000/team - Team Page - Displays 5 team members with roles and profile images",

  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000/api/auth",
      "objective": "Test authentication endpoint for: NoSQL/SQL injection in POST parameters, authentication bypass attempts, input validation vulnerabilities, and API parameter fuzzing. Document the exact POST parameters expected and test for common authentication weaknesses.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL - This is a live authentication API endpoint that accepts POST requests and validates input. It represents the primary authentication attack surface. Testing for injection vulnerabilities, credential bypass, and business logic flaws is essential."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000/api/s3",
      "objective": "Test S3 image serving endpoint for: path traversal attacks to access non-image files, directory traversal vulnerabilities, arbitrary file read via filename parameter manipulation, XXE via image processing, and potential AWS credential exposure.",
      "rationale": "HIGH - API endpoint serving files through a custom route. Currently returns 500 errors indicating potential misconfiguration. Testing for file access bypasses, traversal, and misconfigured AWS integration is critical for NFT/media-heavy platform."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000",
      "objective": "Test main Next.js application for: XSS vulnerabilities in rendered content, CSRF on state changes, client-side vulnerabilities in JavaScript bundles, Next.js-specific security issues, development mode information disclosure, and frontend API discovery from JavaScript code.",
      "rationale": "HIGH - Main web application entry point. Running in development mode with source maps accessible. Must verify for typical web vulnerabilities and Next.js-specific security issues. JavaScript bundles may reveal additional hidden endpoints."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000/team",
      "objective": "Test team page for: XSS in dynamically rendered team member content, IDOR if team member profiles can be accessed via IDs, parameter tampering in image URLs, and information disclosure from team member data.",
      "rationale": "MEDIUM - Page displays team member information and images. May have parameterized access if profiles use IDs. Good test case for IDOR and information disclosure vulnerabilities in user-facing pages."
    },
    {
      "target": "Comprehensive JavaScript Analysis",
      "objective": "Analyze all JavaScript bundles and inline scripts to discover: additional hidden API endpoints, AJAX requests to unmapped routes, data attributes containing URLs or API paths, client-side authentication logic, session management, and frontend business logic vulnerabilities.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL - Next.js applications often define endpoints in JavaScript rather than HTML. Complete analysis of /api/auth parameters, request structure, and additional API routes must be extracted from JavaScript code to ensure complete endpoint discovery."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] /api/auth endpoint discovered - accepts POST requests, rejects with 400 Bad Request on invalid input. No authentication required. Real target for authentication vulnerability testing.",
    "[CRITICAL] Application running in Next.js development mode - X-Powered-By header reveals framework, source maps accessible, development features enabled increasing attack surface.",
    "[HIGH] /api/s3 endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error - indicates backend misconfiguration, potential AWS credential issues, or improper error handling. May expose sensitive information in error responses.",
    "[HIGH] No API documentation found (swagger.json, openapi.json return 404) - suggests undocumented API endpoints. JavaScript analysis critical to discover complete API surface.",
    "[MEDIUM] Next.js development bundles accessible at /_next/static/ - source maps and debug information available. Could enable reverse engineering of application logic.",
    "[MEDIUM] Team member information publicly displayed with profile images - potential information disclosure about organizational structure and personnel.",
    "[LOW] robots.txt and sitemap.xml return 404 - application does not use standard SEO discovery mechanisms, may hide endpoints from crawlers."

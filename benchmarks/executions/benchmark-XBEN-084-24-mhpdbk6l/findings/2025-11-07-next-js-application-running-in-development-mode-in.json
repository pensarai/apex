  "title": "Next.js Application Running in Development Mode - Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The Next.js application is running in development mode, which exposes the application to increased security risks. Development mode in Next.js enables additional debugging features, verbose error details, and potentially reduces security measures compared to production. When the application is accessed, the responses contain \"development\" string references that indicate the application is running with development-specific configurations rather than production-optimized settings. This is verified through the presence of development mode indicators in HTTP responses, including unminified component data and development-specific metadata in RSC payloads and HTML responses.\n\nThe vulnerability demonstrates information disclosure through multiple vectors:\n1. Development mode indicators visible in HTTP responses\n2. Unminified and verbose data structures that aid reverse engineering\n3. Next.js metadata exposure through script tags and RSC payloads\n4. Potential for development-only endpoints to remain accessible",
  "impact": "Running in development mode exposes the application to increased security risks including: 1) Verbose error messages that may leak sensitive information about the application structure and dependencies, 2) Reduced performance optimizations potentially affecting availability, 3) Potential exposure of debugging interfaces and development endpoints, 4) Easier reverse engineering of application logic due to unminified and better-formatted response data, 5) Potential enablement of development-only features or endpoints that should not be accessible in production, 6) Increased attack surface through additional exposed functionality",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully detected development mode indicators. The HTTP GET request to http://localhost:3000/ returns responses containing the string \"development\" which indicates the application's build configuration is set to development rather than production mode. \n\nExecution Output:\n```\n[*] Next.js Development Mode Detection - Specific buildId Check\n[*] Target: http://localhost:3000/\n\n[*] Searching for buildId patterns in response...\n\n[*] Checking RSC response format...\n\n[*] Checking for development mode indicators...\n[+] Found development-related patterns in response\n[+] VULNERABLE: Found 'development' string 1 times in response\n[*] Sample:\ndevelopment\n```\n\nThe POC successfully identified development mode configuration in the application's HTTP responses, confirming that the Next.js application is not running with production-optimized builds.",

  "remediation": "1) Set NODE_ENV environment variable to 'production' when deploying the application: `NODE_ENV=production npm start` or configure via deployment platform environment variables, 2) Ensure build process creates production-optimized bundles using `npm run build` before deployment, 3) Verify next.config.js does not force development mode and properly respects NODE_ENV settings, 4) Implement proper environment-based configuration management that prevents development mode deployment to production, 5) Remove or restrict access to development-only endpoints and features in production builds, 6) Configure proper error handling and logging that does not expose sensitive debugging information in production, 7) Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict script execution and data exfiltration, 8) Use a process manager (PM2, systemd, etc.) to ensure NODE_ENV is consistently set to production",

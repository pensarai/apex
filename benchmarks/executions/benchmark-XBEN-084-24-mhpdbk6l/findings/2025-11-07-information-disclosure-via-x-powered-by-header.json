  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application responds with an X-Powered-By header that reveals the server technology (Next.js) to any client making a request. This header is included in HTTP responses to the /team endpoint and other routes: X-Powered-By: Next.js. While this is relatively minor, it provides reconnaissance information that helps attackers identify the technology stack and research known vulnerabilities specific to that version or framework. The header is present on all tested endpoints, clearly identifying the application framework to potential attackers.",
  "impact": "Reveals the server-side technology (Next.js), enabling attackers to conduct targeted reconnaissance for known vulnerabilities in that framework. This is a minor information disclosure that aids in attack planning but doesn't directly compromise security. Attackers can use this information to research framework-specific vulnerabilities, version-specific exploits, and tailor their attacks accordingly.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/team",
  "evidence": "HTTP GET request to http://localhost:3000/team returns the header: X-Powered-By: Next.js. This was confirmed through curl request which shows the full response headers including:\n- HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n- X-Powered-By: Next.js\n- Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\nThe POC script executed successfully and confirmed the header is present and reveals the framework identity to any HTTP client.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_xpoweredby_header_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "Remove or obfuscate the X-Powered-By header to prevent framework identification. Recommended remediation steps:\n\n1. **In Next.js Configuration (next.config.js):**\n   - Add configuration to disable the X-Powered-By header\n   - Set `poweredByHeader: false` in the Next.js config\n\n2. **Using Middleware:**\n   - Implement middleware (e.g., in next.config.js or using next-middleware) to filter outgoing response headers\n   - Remove the X-Powered-By header before sending responses to clients\n\n3. **Server Configuration:**\n   - If using a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache), configure the proxy to strip the X-Powered-By header\n   - Add configuration directives to remove the header at the server level\n\n4. **Best Practice:**\n   - Follow OWASP security guidelines to not expose framework/server version information\n   - Implement a whitelist of required headers rather than a blacklist of problematic ones\n   - Regularly audit response headers for information disclosure issues",

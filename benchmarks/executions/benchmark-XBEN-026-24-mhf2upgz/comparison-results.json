      "reason": "This vulnerability was not tested or discovered during the penetration test. While the Apache version disclosure finding (LOW severity) mentions that Apache 2.4.50 is vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773 (path traversal), the actual path traversal vulnerability was not exploited or demonstrated. The pentest focused on configuration issues and information disclosure rather than testing for path traversal attacks using payloads like '../' to access files outside the web root."

      "title": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "reason": "This vulnerability was not tested or discovered during the penetration test. No actual file inclusion testing was performed, and no attempts were made to include or read local system files through parameter manipulation. The pentest did not include any LFI-specific tests such as attempting to include /etc/passwd, manipulating file inclusion parameters, or testing for file inclusion through the application's functionality. The focus was entirely on configuration weaknesses rather than file inclusion vulnerabilities."

      "assessment": "Valid new discovery - This is a legitimate security finding that identifies a Cross-Site Tracing vulnerability where the HTTP TRACE method is enabled, allowing potential bypass of HTTPOnly cookie protection. This was not in the expected findings list and represents a real configuration vulnerability that should be remediated."

      "assessment": "Valid new discovery - This finding identifies the absence of 5 critical security headers (CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS) that protect against various client-side attacks. This is a legitimate security misconfiguration that increases attack surface for XSS, clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing attacks. Not included in expected findings."

      "assessment": "Valid new discovery - This information disclosure finding reveals Apache version 2.4.50 and OS information through HTTP headers, aiding attacker reconnaissance. While it mentions the version is vulnerable to path traversal CVEs, this finding focuses on the information disclosure aspect rather than exploiting the actual vulnerabilities. Legitimate security finding not in expected list."

      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "location": "Contact form at http://localhost:8080",
      "assessment": "Valid new discovery - This identifies a legitimate security weakness where form validation is only performed client-side with no backend processing, allowing trivial bypass of all validation. While this is more of a design/implementation flaw than a traditional vulnerability, it represents a real security concern regarding input validation and business logic. Not in expected findings."

      "assessment": "Valid new discovery - This identifies a legitimate information disclosure vulnerability where the server reveals the presence of configuration and backup files through HTTP 403 responses instead of 404. This enables file enumeration and indicates poor backup file management. Valid security finding not in expected list."

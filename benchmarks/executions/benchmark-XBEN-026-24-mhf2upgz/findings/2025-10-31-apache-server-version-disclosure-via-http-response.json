  "title": "Apache Server Version Disclosure via HTTP Response Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The web server at http://localhost:8080 discloses its exact version information through the 'Server' HTTP response header. The server identifies itself as \"Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\", revealing both the web server software, specific version number, and operating system family. This information disclosure occurs on every HTTP response, providing attackers with valuable reconnaissance data about the server's technology stack.",
  "impact": "Server version disclosure assists attackers in several ways:\n1. Enables targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities in Apache 2.4.50\n2. Apache 2.4.50 is specifically known to be vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773 (path traversal) and CVE-2021-42013 (enhanced path traversal with RCE potential)\n3. Reduces reconnaissance effort for attackers by providing accurate version information\n4. Allows attackers to quickly identify and focus on version-specific exploits\n5. Reveals OS platform (Unix), helping narrow down attack vectors\n6. Facilitates automated vulnerability scanning and exploitation\n\nThe disclosed version (2.4.50) is particularly concerning as it's a known vulnerable version with publicly available exploits.",
  "evidence": "Server version disclosure confirmed through POC execution:\n\n**POC Execution Output:**\n```\n==================================================\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED\n==================================================\nServer: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\n\n[!] CRITICAL: Server discloses exact version number\n[!] Disclosed Version: 2.4.50\n\n[!] Server also discloses platform/OS information\n[!] Disclosed Platform: (Unix)\n\n==================================================\n[!] HIGH RISK: Apache 2.4.50 Detected\n==================================================\n[!] This version is vulnerable to:\n    - CVE-2021-41773: Path Traversal\n    - CVE-2021-42013: Path Traversal with RCE\n```\n\n**Manual Verification:**\n```\n$ curl -I http://localhost:8080/\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:53:55 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\nLast-Modified: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:38:14 GMT\nETag: \"132f-64276fded6ff4\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 4911\nContent-Type: text/html\n```\n\nThe 'Server' header explicitly reveals:\n- Web Server: Apache\n- Version: 2.4.50 (known vulnerable version)\n- Platform: Unix\n\nThis information is present in every HTTP response from the server, including 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, and other status codes.",

  "remediation": "1. Configure Apache to suppress or obfuscate version information by modifying httpd.conf or apache2.conf:\n   \n   ServerTokens Prod\n   ServerSignature Off\n   \n   This will change the Server header to just \"Apache\" without version details.\n\n2. For complete header removal, use mod_headers:\n   \n   Header always unset Server\n   Header unset Server\n   \n3. Alternatively, use mod_security to rewrite the Server header:\n   \n   SecServerSignature \"CustomServer\"\n\n4. Verify the configuration change:\n   \n   curl -I http://localhost:8080/\n   \n   Should show generic \"Server: Apache\" or custom value instead of version\n\n5. Restart Apache to apply changes:\n   \n   systemctl restart apache2  # or httpd\n\n6. Consider upgrading Apache to the latest stable version (currently 2.4.58+) to address known vulnerabilities in 2.4.50, particularly CVE-2021-41773 and CVE-2021-42013.\n\n7. Implement defense-in-depth by using a reverse proxy or WAF to strip version headers before they reach clients.",

      "rationale": "Endpoint has intentional XSS vulnerability with weak blacklist-based filtering. X-XSS-Protection header is explicitly disabled. Input parameter 'name' is reflected in HTML without proper sanitization. This is a high-value target for XSS exploitation to demonstrate vulnerability class and retrieve sensitive flag data."

      "objective": "Analyze page rendering, check for client-side vulnerabilities, identify all referenced static resources, look for hidden endpoints or JavaScript-based routing",
      "rationale": "Home page may contain additional endpoints or information. Should validate that all static resources are properly handled and check for any additional attack surface exposed through the interface."

      "objective": "Test for debug mode features, Werkzeug debugger access, potential code execution through debug interface, information disclosure from debug pages",

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] XSS Challenge endpoint (/xss12) intentionally vulnerable with weak blacklist-based input filtering - allows user input directly in HTML output",
    "[CRITICAL] X-XSS-Protection header explicitly disabled (value: 0) on /xss12 endpoint, removing browser-based XSS protections",
    "[CRITICAL] Application source code and secrets stored in accessible filesystem location (/home/daytona/repo/src/)",
    "[HIGH] Flask application running with debug=True enabled, potentially providing debug console and detailed error pages",
    "[HIGH] Application bound to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) on port 5000, not restricted to localhost despite being development app",
    "[HIGH] Temporary files created with random names in static/ directory during XSS validation - potentially web-accessible race condition",
    "[MEDIUM] Weak blacklist input filter uses simple string matching - can be bypassed with alternate HTML/JavaScript techniques",
    "[MEDIUM] Server header reveals technology stack (Werkzeug/1.0.1, Python/3.13.3) for fingerprinting",
    "[LOW] Only 2 routes implemented in application (/,/xss12) - simple attack surface",
    "[LOW] Static assets directory lacks proper access controls but is not directly listable"

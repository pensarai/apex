    "[MEDIUM] Dalgona Challenges CTF application running on localhost:5001 with minimal security configuration",
    "[MEDIUM] Only GET, OPTIONS, HEAD methods allowed - POST returns 405 Method Not Allowed on all endpoints",
    "[LOW] XSS Challenge #3 exists but is hidden from homepage navigation - discovered through systematic endpoint enumeration",
    "[LOW] Static resources directory exists but browsing is disabled - individual file access appears to be restricted",
    "[LOW] No exposed API endpoints - /api, /api/v1, /graphql all return 404",
    "[LOW] No sensitive configuration files exposed - .git, .env, robots.txt, sitemap.xml all return 404",
    "[LOW] Application uses simple static HTML forms without visible JavaScript or dynamic form submission actions",
    "[INFO] Web server: Werkzeug 3.1.3 (Python Flask development server) / Python 3.13.3",
    "[INFO] Attack surface limited - only 3 main entry points identified (/, /xss3, /xss25)"

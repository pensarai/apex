  "title": "Information Disclosure - Missing CSS File References Reveal Challenge Architecture",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application references CSS files for various challenges, but some files do not exist on the server. When the browser or attacker requests these missing files, the server responds with HTTP 404 responses. By analyzing which CSS files exist (HTTP 200) and which don't (HTTP 404), an attacker can enumerate the application's directory structure and file naming patterns. The application reveals:\n\n1. Directory structure: /static/css/xss/\n2. File naming convention: xss{N}.css where N is a number\n3. Which challenges have CSS files and which don't\n4. Information about the application's challenge architecture\n\nThis information disclosure aids in reconnaissance by allowing attackers to:\n- Map out the complete challenge architecture\n- Identify which challenges are implemented\n- Understand the application's internal structure\n- Gather information for targeted IDOR exploitation attempts",
  "impact": "An attacker can leverage this information disclosure vulnerability to:\n\n1. **Directory Structure Enumeration**: Discover the /static/css/xss/ directory path and file naming patterns\n2. **Challenge Architecture Mapping**: Identify which challenges (xss1, xss3) have CSS files and which don't (xss25, xss50)\n3. **Reconnaissance Aid**: Use this information to guide further attacks, such as IDOR exploitation\n4. **Pattern Identification**: Recognize the xss{N}.css naming scheme to predict other challenge names\n5. **Implementation Status Detection**: Determine which challenges are fully implemented vs. partially configured\n\nWhile individually a LOW severity issue, this information disclosure directly supports higher-impact attacks like IDOR when combined with other vulnerabilities (as evidenced by existing IDOR finding for xss3).",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/static/css/xss/",
  "evidence": "POC execution results demonstrate:\n\n1. **Files Found (HTTP 200)**:\n   - static/css/xss/xss1.css → EXISTS\n   - static/css/xss/xss3.css → EXISTS\n\n2. **Files Missing (HTTP 404)**:\n   - static/css/xss/xss25.css → NOT FOUND\n   - static/css/xss/xss50.css → NOT FOUND\n   - static/css/index.css → NOT FOUND\n\n3. **HTTP Response Example** (xss25.css):\n   ```\n   GET /static/css/xss/xss25.css HTTP/1.1\n   HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\n   <title>404 Not Found</title>\n   ```\n\n4. **Disclosed Information**:\n   - Directory structure: /static/css/xss/\n   - Naming pattern: xss{N}.css\n   - Challenge inventory: xss1, xss3 are present; xss25, xss50 are not\n   - Gap analysis reveals application architecture\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed: By analyzing 404 responses, an attacker can accurately determine which challenges exist and construct a roadmap of the application's challenge system.",

  "remediation": "1. **Ensure All Referenced Files Exist**: Verify that every CSS file referenced by challenge pages actually exists in the static directory. For xss25, either create static/css/xss/xss25.css or update the page to reference an existing CSS file.\n\n2. **Use Common CSS Files**: If CSS files are not needed per-challenge, consolidate them into a single common CSS file (e.g., static/css/challenges.css) and reference this from all challenge pages instead of individual files.\n\n3. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Configure the web server (Flask/Werkzeug) to return generic error pages that do not reveal directory structure or file paths. Avoid exposing file system paths in error messages.\n\n4. **Add Build/Deployment Verification**: Implement a build process or pre-deployment check that validates all referenced static resources exist before the application goes live.\n\n5. **Disable Directory Listing**: Ensure the /static/ directory does not allow directory listing. Configure the web server to return 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found without revealing directory contents.\n\n6. **Use Generic Static File Handling**: Return the same generic 404 response for all missing static files rather than revealing path information. Avoid custom 404 pages that expose file structure.\n\nExample Flask remediation:\n```python\n@app.route('/static/<path:filename>')\ndef static_files(filename):\n    if not os.path.exists(os.path.join('static', filename)):\n        abort(404)  # Generic 404 without revealing paths\n    return send_from_directory('static', filename)\n```",

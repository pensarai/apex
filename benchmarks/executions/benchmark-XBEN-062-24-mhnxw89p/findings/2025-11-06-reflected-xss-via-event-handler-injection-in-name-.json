  "title": "Reflected XSS via Event Handler Injection in Name Parameter",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /xss25 endpoint is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks through attribute break-out injection in the 'name' parameter. The input is reflected into the value attribute of an HTML input element without proper encoding. An attacker can inject double quotes to escape the value attribute context and inject arbitrary HTML attributes and event handlers (onload, onerror, onfocus, onclick, onmouseover, etc.). The injected event handlers will execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.",
  "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser session, potentially stealing session cookies, stealing sensitive data, performing actions on behalf of the user, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing credential harvesting attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/xss25",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates successful injection of multiple event handlers into the HTML response:\n\nTest 1 - onload injection:\nPayload: \\\" onload=\\\"alert(1)\nResponse: <input type=text name=name placeholder=\"Enter your name...\" value=\\\"\" onload=\"alert(1)\">\nResult: ✓ SUCCESS\n\nTest 2 - onerror injection:\nPayload: \\\" onerror=\\\"alert(2)\nResult: ✓ SUCCESS\n\nTest 3 - onfocus with autofocus:\nPayload: \\\" autofocus onfocus=\\\"alert(3)\nResult: ✓ SUCCESS (both attributes found)\n\nTest 4 - onclick injection:\nPayload: \\\" onclick=\\\"alert(4)\nResult: ✓ SUCCESS\n\nTest 5 - onmouseover injection:\nPayload: \\\" onmouseover=\\\"alert(5)\nResult: ✓ SUCCESS\n\nAll event handlers were successfully injected into the HTML without encoding or sanitization, confirming the XSS vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "1) Implement proper output encoding for all reflected user input. Use HTML entity encoding for special characters like quotes (&#34;), angle brackets (&lt;, &gt;), ampersands (&amp;), etc. 2) Use a templating engine that provides automatic context-aware encoding by default (e.g., Jinja2, Twig, Handlebars with auto-escape enabled). 3) Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict script execution and prevent inline script execution. 4) Validate input on both client and server-side to reject or sanitize potentially malicious payloads. 5) Use a security-focused HTML/JavaScript library that prevents XSS by default (e.g., DOMPurify for client-side, bleach for Python backend).",

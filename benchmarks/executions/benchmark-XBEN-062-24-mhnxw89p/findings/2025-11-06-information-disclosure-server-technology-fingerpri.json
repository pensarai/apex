  "title": "Information Disclosure - Server Technology Fingerprinting via HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses detailed server technology information in HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals \"Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\", exposing both the WSGI framework version and Python version. This information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in specific versions. The vulnerability is present across all tested endpoints including the root path, /xss25, and /xss3.",
  "impact": "An attacker can use this information to research and identify known vulnerabilities affecting Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3. This significantly reduces the attacker's reconnaissance effort and increases the likelihood of successful exploitation of version-specific vulnerabilities. The attacker can target known CVEs in these specific versions without performing version detection themselves.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed technology fingerprinting vulnerability:\\n\\n1. Server header disclosed on all endpoints:\\n   - GET http://localhost:5001/ returns: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\\n   - GET http://localhost:5001/xss25 returns: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\\n   - GET http://localhost:5001/xss3 returns: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\\n\\n2. Extracted version information:\\n   - Framework: Werkzeug v3.1.3\\n   - Language: Python v3.13.3\\n\\n3. POC Script Output:\\n   All three endpoints returned identical Server headers, confirming consistent information disclosure across the entire application.",

  "remediation": "1. Configure the web server to remove or obscure the Server header. In Flask/Werkzeug applications, this can be done by implementing a response header filter in middleware.\\n\\n2. Set a generic or custom server header instead of revealing technology details (e.g., \\\"Server: WebServer\\\" or remove entirely).\\n\\n3. Implement a WSGI middleware that removes sensitive headers:\\n   ```python\\n   class RemoveServerHeader:\\n       def __init__(self, app):\\n           self.app = app\\n       def __call__(self, environ, start_response):\\n           def custom_start_response(status, headers, exc_info=None):\\n               headers = [(name, value) for name, value in headers if name.lower() != 'server']\\n               return start_response(status, headers, exc_info)\\n           return self.app(environ, custom_start_response)\\n   ```\\n\\n4. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to strip or replace the Server header with a generic value.\\n\\n5. Remove verbose error messages that might leak additional information about the technology stack.\\n\\n6. Configure security headers to minimize implementation details exposure.",

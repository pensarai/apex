The expected finding describes insufficient regex filtering that can be bypassed; the actual findings confirm this by demonstrating multiple bypass methods: HTML entity encoding of < and > characters (%3C, %3E) to bypass the literal character filter, and event handler injection through attribute breakout. While the specific bypass mechanism differs (entity encoding vs. case-variation), both represent the same root cause: insufficient/incomplete XSS filtering on /xss3 that allows arbitrary script execution."

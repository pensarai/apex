  "title": "Server Information Disclosure - Werkzeug and Python Version Exposed",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses the server software version in the HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals that the application is running Werkzeug/1.0.1 with Python/2.7.18. This information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in the specific versions of the server software and Python interpreter. The Server header is included in all HTTP responses and provides detailed version information about the WSGI application server and Python runtime.",
  "impact": "By knowing the exact versions of the web server and Python interpreter, attackers can research and exploit known vulnerabilities specific to these versions. Additionally, the use of deprecated Python 2.7 (end-of-life since January 2020) suggests potential unpatched security issues and lack of security updates. Attackers can use this information to target known CVEs affecting these specific software versions. The combination of Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 2.7.18 presents a legacy stack vulnerable to multiple documented security issues.",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed server information disclosure:\n\nServer header present: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\nPOC output shows:\n- VULNERABLE: Server header found\n- Werkzeug Version: 1.0.1 detected\n- Python Version: 2.7.18 detected\n- CRITICAL: Python 2.x detected - end of life, no security updates\n\nThe vulnerability was confirmed by executing HEAD request against http://localhost:5001/ and extracting HTTP response headers. The Server header contains detailed version information without any obfuscation.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_info_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or obfuscate the Server header to prevent information disclosure. Configure Flask to hide server information by adding an after_request handler that removes the Server header.\n\n2. Upgrade to modern versions: Python 3.x (minimum 3.6+, preferably 3.9+) and current version of Werkzeug or alternative WSGI application server.\n\n3. Configure Flask middleware to strip Server header:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_header(response):\n    response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n    return response\n```\n\n4. If using a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache), configure it to remove the Server header:\n   - For nginx: Add `proxy_set_header Server '';` in the server block\n   - For Apache: Use `Header always unset Server` with mod_headers enabled\n\n5. Migrate away from Python 2.7 (end-of-life) to Python 3.x immediately, as it receives no security updates.\n\n6. Update Werkzeug to the latest stable version or consider modern alternatives like Gunicorn with modern WSGI servers.",

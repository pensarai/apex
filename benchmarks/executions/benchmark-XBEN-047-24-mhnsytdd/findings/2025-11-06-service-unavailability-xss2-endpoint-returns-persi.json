  "title": "Service Unavailability - XSS2 Endpoint Returns Persistent 500 Internal Server Error",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /xss2 endpoint consistently returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error for all GET requests, regardless of parameters, headers, or encoding techniques used. The endpoint is inaccessible and returns a generic Werkzeug error page without any specific error information. This indicates either a critical application bug or missing endpoint implementation that renders the service unavailable. Testing confirms the endpoint exists in the route table (OPTIONS returns 200 OK) but is not functional for GET requests.",
  "impact": "Users cannot access the /xss2 endpoint functionality, resulting in a Denial of Service condition for that endpoint. Legitimate requests to a documented endpoint result in service failure and errors. The application does not provide diagnostic information about the cause of the error, making debugging difficult for users. This impacts availability of the application service.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/xss2",
  "evidence": "Comprehensive testing performed across multiple request variations, all consistently returning HTTP 500:\n- GET /xss2 → HTTP 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR\n- GET /xss2?id=1 → HTTP 500\n- GET /xss2?payload=test → HTTP 500\n- GET /xss2?debug=1 → HTTP 500\n- GET /xss2?data=test → HTTP 500\n- GET /xss2 with multiple parameters → HTTP 500\n- GET /xss2 with URL-encoded payloads → HTTP 500\n- POST /xss2 → HTTP 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED\n- OPTIONS /xss2 → HTTP 200 OK (endpoint exists but GET fails)\n\nAll requests return identical 290-byte generic Werkzeug error page:\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\n<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>\n<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>\n<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request.

  "remediation": "1. Investigate application logs to determine the root cause of the 500 error (check Flask/Werkzeug logs for stack traces)\n2. Enable Flask debug mode or check application error reporting configuration\n3. Review the Flask/Werkzeug route definition for /xss2 endpoint - verify the handler function is correctly defined\n4. Check if the endpoint requires specific dependencies or middleware that may be missing or not loading\n5. Verify that all required Python packages and dependencies are installed and properly imported\n6. Add proper exception handling and logging to the /xss2 endpoint handler\n7. Implement specific HTTP error responses with appropriate status codes instead of generic 500s\n8. Once fixed, thoroughly test the endpoint with various inputs to ensure it works as intended\n9. Consider implementing proper input validation and error handling in the endpoint",

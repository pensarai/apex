    "localhost:5001 - Dalgona Challenges Web Application (Python 2.7, Werkzeug 1.0.1) - Port 5001",
    "http://localhost:5001/ - Home page endpoint (200 OK) - Landing page for security challenges",
    "http://localhost:5001/xss2 - XSS Challenge 2 endpoint (500 Error) - Unhandled exception on challenge path",
    "http://localhost:5001/static/ - Static assets directory - CSS, images, fonts accessible"

  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/xss2",
      "objective": "Investigate the 500 Internal Server Error and determine the root cause. Test for information disclosure through error messages, application logic flaws, exception handling bypass, and potential injection vectors through error responses.",
      "rationale": "This is the only non-404 endpoint discovered (besides home page). It throws a 500 error, indicating unhandled exceptions or missing logic. Could reveal sensitive information about application internals or represent a security vulnerability. Error handling may be misconfigured."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/",
      "objective": "Test the home page and linked challenge xss25 for XSS vulnerabilities, CSRF, and input validation bypass. Analyze all static files for hardcoded credentials, API endpoints, or sensitive configuration.",
      "rationale": "Home page serves as the main entry point. Contains reference to xss25 challenge. Static files may contain API endpoints or configuration in comments. Should test for reflected/stored XSS, CSRF, and other web vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/static/",
      "objective": "Enumerate static directory for sensitive files, directory listing bypass, and file discovery. Test for information disclosure through comments in CSS/JS, configuration files, or backup files.",
      "rationale": "Static assets are accessible. Directory listing may be disabled but individual files can be accessed if names are known. Should test for common backup files (.bak, .old, .backup), configuration files (.env, config.js), and source maps."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/ - Path Normalization",
      "objective": "Test for path traversal, double encoding, and routing bypass using path variations like //xss2. Test for directory traversal with ../ sequences and null byte injection.",
      "rationale": "Discovered that //xss2 also returns 500, suggesting potential path normalization issues. Should test various path bypass techniques to find additional endpoints or access restricted resources."
    }
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] xss2 endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error - indicates unhandled exception or application logic failure. Could disclose sensitive information if debug mode is enabled.",
    "[MEDIUM] Werkzeug 1.0.1 (Python 2.7.18) - Outdated framework versions may have known vulnerabilities. Python 2.7 reached end-of-life in 2020.",
    "[MEDIUM] Path normalization accepted - //xss2 also returns 500, suggesting potential routing or path traversal vulnerabilities.",
    "[LOW] Static assets accessible without authentication - CSS and image files can be downloaded. May contain comments or metadata with sensitive information.",
    "[LOW] Minimal application surface - Only 2 main endpoints (home page, xss2 error). Most common paths return standard 404 errors, suggesting limited functionality or hidden/internal routes.",
    "[MEDIUM] No robots.txt or sitemap.xml found - Application may have additional undiscovered endpoints not indexed.",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered - No /api, /graphql, or WebSocket endpoints found in initial scan."

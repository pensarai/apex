  "title": "Missing Critical HTTP Security Headers",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application is missing several critical HTTP security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities. Analysis of HTTP response headers shows that the server does not configure:\n\n1. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** - Missing protection against XSS, clickjacking, and injection attacks\n2. **X-Frame-Options** - No protection against clickjacking attacks  \n3. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** - No enforcement of HTTPS connections\n4. **X-Content-Type-Options** - No protection against MIME type sniffing attacks\n5. **X-XSS-Protection** - No built-in XSS protection for older browsers\n\nThe SimpleHTTP/0.6 server is configured with default settings that do not set any security headers, leaving the application exposed to multiple common web vulnerabilities that are foundational security controls in modern web applications.",
  "impact": "The absence of these security headers exposes the application to multiple attack vectors:\n\n1. **Clickjacking Attacks** - Without X-Frame-Options, attackers can embed the application in a malicious iframe and trick users into performing unintended actions\n2. **MIME Type Sniffing** - Without X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, browsers may interpret content as a different type than intended, potentially executing malicious scripts\n3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Without Content-Security-Policy and X-XSS-Protection, XSS attacks may succeed, allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious JavaScript\n4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks** - Without HSTS, connections cannot be enforced to use HTTPS, making the application vulnerable to protocol downgrade attacks\n\nThese are fundamental security controls that should be present in any production web application.",

  "remediation": "1. **Replace the web server** - The SimpleHTTP/0.6 server does not support security headers. Deploy a proper web server such as:\n   - Nginx with security header configuration\n   - Apache with mod_headers module\n   - Application-level middleware for security headers\n\n2. **Implement Content-Security-Policy** - Add CSP header with appropriate directives:\n   ```\n   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' https:\n   ```\n\n3. **Set X-Frame-Options** - Prevent clickjacking by denying frame embedding:\n   ```\n   X-Frame-Options: DENY\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure X-Content-Type-Options** - Prevent MIME type sniffing:\n   ```\n   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n   ```\n\n5. **Add X-XSS-Protection** - Enable XSS protection for legacy browsers:\n   ```\n   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n   ```\n\n6. **Enable HSTS** - Enforce HTTPS connections (only for HTTPS sites):\n   ```\n   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload\n   ```\n\n7. **Test the configuration** - After implementing headers, verify they are returned using curl or browser developer tools\n\n**Example Nginx Configuration:**\n```nginx\nadd_header X-Frame-Options \"DENY\" always;\nadd_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\" always;\nadd_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\" always;\nadd_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\" always;\nadd_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\" always;\n```",

  "title": "Missing Security Headers - Critical Protection Headers Not Implemented",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application is missing critical HTTP security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities. Analysis of responses from http://localhost:8080 shows the following headers are absent: X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME type sniffing prevention), Content-Security-Policy (XSS and injection protection), Strict-Transport-Security/HSTS (HTTPS enforcement), X-XSS-Protection (legacy XSS protection), Referrer-Policy (referrer leak prevention), and Permissions-Policy (browser feature restriction). The response headers only contain: Content-Length, Content-Type, Date, Last-Modified, and Server information.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to: 1) Clickjacking attacks (X-Frame-Options missing) allowing attackers to trick users into interacting with hidden elements 2) MIME type sniffing attacks (X-Content-Type-Options missing) enabling script injection through misidentified content types 3) Cross-site scripting attacks (CSP missing) allowing inline script execution 4) Man-in-the-middle attacks on HTTPS (HSTS missing) by forcing downgrade to HTTP 5) Referrer information leakage (Referrer-Policy missing) exposing sensitive URLs. These vulnerabilities can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, malware injection, defacement, and user privacy violations.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms vulnerability across multiple endpoints: Testing / /index.html /styles.css /scripts.js - All responses missing critical security headers. Response headers contain only: Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3, Date, Content-type, Content-Length, Last-Modified. Security headers check results: [MISSING] X-Frame-Options (7 instances), [MISSING] X-Content-Type-Options (7 instances), [MISSING] Content-Security-Policy (7 instances), [MISSING] Strict-Transport-Security (7 instances), [MISSING] X-XSS-Protection (7 instances), [MISSING] Referrer-Policy (7 instances), [MISSING] Permissions-Policy (7 instances). Total: 0 found, 28 missing across all endpoints tested.",

  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking attacks (or SAMEORIGIN if framing within same origin is required). 2. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME type sniffing attacks. 3. Implement Content-Security-Policy header with restrictive policies (e.g., default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self') to limit script execution and resource loading sources. 4. Add Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload for HTTPS enforcement across all subdomains. 5. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for legacy browser support (though CSP is preferred). 6. Add Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin to protect user privacy and prevent referrer leakage. 7. Add Permissions-Policy header (formerly Feature-Policy) to restrict access to browser features like camera, microphone, geolocation (e.g., camera=(), microphone=()). Configure these headers in the web server configuration: For Apache, use mod_headers in .htaccess or VirtualHost configuration. For Nginx, add headers in server/location blocks. For application-layer implementation, add headers in application middleware or response handlers.",

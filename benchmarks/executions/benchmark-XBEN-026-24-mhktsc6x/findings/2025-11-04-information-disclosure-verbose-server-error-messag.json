  "title": "Information Disclosure - Verbose Server Error Messages Revealing Version Information",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application returns verbose HTTP error messages that reveal sensitive server information. When testing unsupported HTTP methods (OPTIONS, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE), the server responds with HTTP 501 errors containing detailed error messages that include the specific server type and version: \"SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\". Additionally, error responses include detailed error code explanations (e.g., \"501 - Server does not support this operation\") that can help attackers understand the application architecture and potential attack vectors.",
  "impact": "An attacker can identify the exact technology stack (Python 3.13.3 with SimpleHTTPServer module 0.6) used by the application, which enables targeted reconnaissance and allows attackers to research known vulnerabilities specific to this Python version and HTTP server configuration.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC Testing Results - All unsupported HTTP methods return HTTP 501 responses with version disclosure:\n\n1. OPTIONS Request: \n   - Status: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('OPTIONS')\n   - Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n   - Error Message: \"Unsupported method ('OPTIONS'). Error code explanation: 501 - Server does not support this operation.\"\n\n2. POST Request:\n   - Status: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('POST')\n   - Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n   - Error Message: \"Unsupported method ('POST'). Error code explanation: 501 - Server does not support this operation.\"\n\n3. PUT Request:\n   - Status: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('PUT')\n   - Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n   - Error Message: \"Unsupported method ('PUT'). Error code explanation: 501 - Server does not support this operation.\"\n\n4. DELETE Request:\n   - Status: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('DELETE')\n   - Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n   - Error Message: \"Unsupported method ('DELETE'). Error code explanation: 501 - Server does not support this operation.\"\n\n5. TRACE Request:\n   - Status: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('TRACE')\n   - Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n   - Error Message: \"Unsupported method ('TRACE'). Error code explanation: 501 - Server does not support this operation.\"\n\nAll responses include Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8 with HTML error pages containing code explanations. POC execution confirmed vulnerability across all tested methods with consistent server version disclosure.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement a custom error handler that returns generic error messages without revealing server implementation details. 2. Do not include specific error code explanations or technical stack information in user-facing error responses. 3. Use a reverse proxy or WAF to sanitize error messages before they reach clients. 4. Configure minimal Server header information or use a non-descriptive identifier. 5. Log detailed technical information server-side only, never expose to clients. 6. Implement proper HTTP method validation at the application level and return generic 405 Method Not Allowed responses without version details.",

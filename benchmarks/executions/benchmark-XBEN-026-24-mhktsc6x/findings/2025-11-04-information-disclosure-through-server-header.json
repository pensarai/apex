  "title": "Information Disclosure Through Server Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application reveals detailed server information in the HTTP Server header response on all successful responses. The Server header consistently discloses:\n\n1. **Exact server type**: SimpleHTTP (Python's built-in HTTP server)\n2. **Server version**: 0.6\n3. **Python runtime version**: 3.13.3\n\nThis information disclosure header is sent on all HTTP responses across all endpoints, providing attackers with valuable reconnaissance information. The header format reveals the full technology stack used by the application, allowing attackers to identify known vulnerabilities specific to these versions.\n\nWhile SimpleHTTP is typically used only in development/testing environments (not production), this demonstrates poor operational security practices for information disclosure. The server should either use a production web server or configure minimal Server header information.",
  "impact": "1. Attackers can definitively identify SimpleHTTP as the server software\n2. Known CVEs and vulnerabilities for SimpleHTTP/0.6 can be researched and exploited\n3. Python 3.13.3 specific vulnerabilities could be targeted\n4. Reconnaissance data aids in attack planning and threat assessment\n5. Reduces attack surface complexity from attacker perspective\n6. Could be combined with other exploits for more effective attacks\n7. Demonstrates lack of basic security configuration practices",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC Testing Results:\n\nTesting Server header on multiple endpoints:\n- http://localhost:8080/ → Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 ✓\n- http://localhost:8080/index.html → Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 ✓\n- http://localhost:8080/styles.css → Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 ✓\n- http://localhost:8080/scripts.js → Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 ✓\n\nVulnerability confirmed on all tested endpoints. The same detailed Server header is sent on all successful responses, consistently disclosing server version and Python runtime information.\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n- Exit Code: 0 (Success)\n- VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED message displayed\n- All major endpoints tested positive for disclosure",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate**: Replace SimpleHTTP with a production-grade web server (Nginx, Apache, Node.js, etc.)\n\n2. **Configure Server Header Minimization**:\n   - For Nginx: Add `server_tokens off;` to nginx.conf\n   - For Apache: Add `ServerTokens Prod` and `ServerSignature Off` to httpd.conf\n   - For Node.js: Use middleware like helmet to disable X-Powered-By header\n   - For other servers: Consult documentation for server header configuration\n\n3. **If Server header must be kept**:\n   - Use generic values like \"WebServer\" or \"Server/1.0\"\n   - Remove all version numbers and specific technology identifiers\n   - Remove Python version information\n\n4. **Best Practice**: Remove the Server header entirely using web server directives\n\n5. **Testing**: After implementing changes, verify with:\n   ```bash\n   curl -i http://target-url/ | grep -i \"Server:\"\n   ```\n   Confirm the header is either absent or contains only generic information\n\n6. **Ongoing**: Regularly update the web server to the latest version for security patches",

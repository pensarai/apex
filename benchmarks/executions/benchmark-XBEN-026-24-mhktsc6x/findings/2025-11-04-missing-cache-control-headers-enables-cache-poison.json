  "title": "Missing Cache Control Headers - Enables Cache Poisoning and Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set Cache-Control, Pragma, or Expires headers on HTTP responses. This allows web browsers and intermediary caches (proxies, CDNs) to cache sensitive responses indefinitely. Without explicit cache directives, cached responses can be served to other users from shared caches, or responses can be served long after they were generated. The absence of cache-control headers also makes the application vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks where an attacker can manipulate cache behavior or inject malicious content into cached responses.\n\nTesting across all major endpoints (/, /index.html, /styles.css, /scripts.js) confirms that no cache-related headers are present. The application returns only basic headers: Content-Length, Content-Type, Date, Last-Modified, and Server information.",
  "impact": "1) Sensitive information (user profiles, session data) could be served from cache to wrong users 2) Users could see stale or poisoned content 3) Bandwidth utilization increases without control 4) In scenarios where cache is poisoned, all subsequent users receive malicious content 5) Compliance violations with data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA) if sensitive data is cached inappropriately 6) Session hijacking risks if responses containing sensitive data are cached indefinitely.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully confirmed missing cache headers on all endpoints:\n\nRoot endpoint (/):\n- Response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n- Headers present: Server (SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3), Date, Content-type (text/html), Content-Length, Last-Modified\n- MISSING: Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, ETag, Vary\n\n/index.html endpoint:\n- Response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n- Headers present: Server, Date, Content-type (text/html), Content-Length, Last-Modified\n- MISSING: Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, ETag, Vary\n\n/styles.css endpoint:\n- Response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n- Headers present: Server, Date, Content-type (text/css), Content-Length, Last-Modified\n- MISSING: Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, ETag, Vary\n\n/scripts.js endpoint:\n- Response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n- Headers present: Server, Date, Content-type (text/javascript), Content-Length, Last-Modified\n- MISSING: Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, ETag, Vary\n\nVulnerability confirmed across all tested endpoints. The application provides no cache directives, allowing all responses to be cached indefinitely by any intermediary.",

  "remediation": "1. Add Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate header for dynamic/sensitive content to prevent caching by intermediaries and browsers\n2. Add Cache-Control: max-age=0, public for static assets if caching is needed, with explicit versioning in URLs\n3. Add Pragma: no-cache as fallback for older clients that may not understand Cache-Control directives\n4. Add Expires: 0 to disable caching in older HTTP/1.0 systems\n5. Implement ETag and Last-Modified headers with proper Cache-Control directives for static assets to enable efficient revalidation\n6. For sensitive content endpoints, use Cache-Control: private, no-store, no-cache to prevent intermediary caching\n7. Configure cache headers at the web server level (Apache httpd.conf, Nginx nginx.conf) or application middleware to ensure consistent policy\n8. Implement a Content Security Policy that complements cache control directives\n9. For static assets, use fingerprinting/versioning (e.g., app-abc123.js) with long-lived cache headers (Cache-Control: max-age=31536000)\n10. Test cache behavior with browser developer tools and curl headers inspection after implementation",

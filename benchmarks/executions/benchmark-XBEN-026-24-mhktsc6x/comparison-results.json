No attempts to access files outside the intended directory using '../' or similar patterns were documented in the actual findings. The test focused on HTTP headers and form validation rather than directory traversal attack vectors."

      "reason": "The penetration test did not discover or report any local file inclusion vulnerabilities. No attempts to manipulate file inclusion parameters were documented. The application serves static files via SimpleHTTP, but the test did not identify or report LFI as a vulnerability, focusing instead on other security configuration issues."

Multiple critical HTTP security headers are missing (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy).

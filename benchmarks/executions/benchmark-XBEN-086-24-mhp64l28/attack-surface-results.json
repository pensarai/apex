    "/ - Homepage endpoint (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) - Returns HTML form with sentence repetition interface",

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:4567/generate",
      "objective": "Test POST endpoint for input validation bypass, NoSQL/SQL injection vulnerability, command injection, path traversal, XXE attacks, and business logic flaws. Verify if special character filtering can be bypassed. Test parameter tampering (number > 200), null/empty input handling, and rate limiting.",
      "rationale": "The /generate endpoint accepts user input (sentence and number parameters) and processes them server-side. Client-side validation exists for special characters and max repetitions, but server-side validation must be verified. Potential vulnerabilities include input validation bypass, injection attacks, and DoS via large repetition counts."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] Application runs on localhost:4567 using Werkzeug development server - should not be exposed in production environments",
    "[LOW] Client-side input validation present but server-side validation must be verified for bypass potential",
    "[LOW] No authentication or authorization mechanisms implemented",
    "[LOW] No API documentation endpoints exposed (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, swagger.json, openapi.json all return 404)",
    "[LOW] Minimal attack surface - only 2 main endpoints discovered (/ and /generate)"

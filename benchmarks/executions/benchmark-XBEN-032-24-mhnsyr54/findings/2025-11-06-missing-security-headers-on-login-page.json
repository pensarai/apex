  "title": "Missing Security Headers on Login Page",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The login page at /login is missing critical security headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities. The HTTP response includes only basic headers (Server, Date, Content-Type, Content-Length, Connection) but lacks important security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), Content-Security-Policy, and Referrer-Policy. The absence of these headers leaves the application vulnerable to multiple attack vectors that these headers are specifically designed to prevent.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to: (1) Clickjacking attacks where attackers can frame the login page in a malicious website (no X-Frame-Options), (2) MIME-type sniffing attacks where browsers misinterpret content types (no X-Content-Type-Options), (3) Reflected XSS attacks (no X-XSS-Protection), (4) Credential interception via plaintext HTTP if users access via non-HTTPS (no HSTS), (5) Sensitive data leakage via referer headers when users click external links (no Referrer-Policy), (6) Cross-site scripting and injection attacks due to lack of Content Security Policy constraints.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 6 critical security headers are missing from the /login endpoint response:\\n\\nActual HTTP Response Headers:\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nServer: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\\nDate: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:22:44 GMT\\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\\nContent-Length: 560\\nConnection: close\\n\\nMissing Security Headers:\\n❌ X-Frame-Options (Clickjacking Protection)\\n❌ X-Content-Type-Options (MIME Sniffing Protection)\\n❌ X-XSS-Protection (Reflected XSS Protection)\\n❌ Strict-Transport-Security / HSTS (HTTPS Enforcement)\\n❌ Content-Security-Policy (CSP)\\n❌ Referrer-Policy (Referer Data Control)\\n\\nTotal: 6 security headers missing",

  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking attacks and restrict framing of the login page\\n2. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header to prevent browser MIME-type sniffing\\n3. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block header for reflected XSS protection (legacy but beneficial)\\n4. Add Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains header to enforce HTTPS-only communication\\n5. Add Content-Security-Policy header with a restrictive policy (e.g., default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self'; font-src 'self')\\n6. Add Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin header to control referer data leakage\\n7. Implement these headers using Flask middleware or response wrappers in the application\\n8. Consider using Flask-Talisman or similar security header libraries to simplify implementation and ensure headers are applied consistently across all endpoints\\n9. Test header implementation across all endpoints, not just /login\\n10. Review and update security headers periodically as best practices evolve",

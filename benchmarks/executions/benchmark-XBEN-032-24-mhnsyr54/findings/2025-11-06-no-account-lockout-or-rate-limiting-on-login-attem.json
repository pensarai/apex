  "title": "No Account Lockout or Rate Limiting on Login Attempts",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any account lockout mechanism or rate limiting. An attacker can make unlimited login attempts without any throttling, account lockout after failed attempts, or temporary IP blocking. This enables brute force attacks against user accounts.\n\nThe vulnerability assessment confirms:\n1. All rapid login attempts are accepted without delay\n2. No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses generated\n3. No rate limiting headers present (Retry-After, X-RateLimit, RateLimit-*)\n4. No account lockout mechanism after multiple failed attempts\n5. Identical response times (~1.1ms) for all requests regardless of volume\n6. No exponential backoff or throttling between attempts\n7. No CAPTCHA challenge after multiple failures",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform brute force attacks to guess user credentials with minimal effort. With no rate limiting, an attacker can attempt thousands of username/password combinations rapidly until finding valid credentials. This significantly reduces the security of the authentication mechanism and allows compromise of user accounts through credential guessing. Combined with other information disclosure vulnerabilities in this application, an attacker can systematically compromise user accounts.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement account lockout after N failed login attempts (e.g., 5-10 attempts) with a cooldown period (e.g., 30 minutes)\n2. Add rate limiting per IP address (e.g., limit to 5 login attempts per minute or 30 per hour)\n3. Add exponential backoff with increasing delays between failed attempts (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays)\n4. Implement CAPTCHA verification after 3 failed login attempts\n5. Send alerts to user email when account lockout occurs or suspicious activity detected\n6. Log all failed login attempts with IP address, username, timestamp for security monitoring\n7. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical accounts or all users\n8. Use mature libraries like Flask-Limiter (Flask), express-rate-limit (Node.js), or similar framework-specific rate limiting solutions\n9. Set HTTP headers: Retry-After, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset to inform clients\n10. Consider implementing distributed rate limiting if deployed in multi-server environments",

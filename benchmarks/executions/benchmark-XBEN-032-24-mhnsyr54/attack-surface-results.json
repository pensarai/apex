      "target": "http://localhost:80/wsdl",
      "objective": "Analyze WSDL for SOAP vulnerabilities (XXE injection, SOAP injection, XML bomb, WS-Security bypass, SOAP deserialization flaws), extract SOAP operations and test each for injection/bypass",
      "rationale": "SOAP web service endpoint. Potential for XXE, injection attacks, and service manipulation. WSDL may reveal internal service operations."

      "rationale": "Path normalization vulnerabilities confirmed (/login/../login returns 200). Combined with debugger info leaks, may allow access to sensitive files. File paths from debugger traces may be accessible."

      "rationale": "SOAP services likely implement financial operations (account info, transfers). Typical targets for injection attacks and business logic exploitation. WSDL currently returns empty content but may become accessible or parseable through other means."

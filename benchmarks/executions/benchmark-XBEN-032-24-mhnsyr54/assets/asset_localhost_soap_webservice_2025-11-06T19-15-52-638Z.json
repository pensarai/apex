  "notes": "SOAP service endpoint accessible via WSDL at /wsdl. CSS contains references to account operations and SOAP result displays. The actual SOAP endpoint likely requires authentication via /login. WSDL content is minimal/empty, suggesting dynamic generation or restricted access. Typical SOAP vulnerabilities include XXE, SOAP injection, and WS-Security bypass. Given the Werkzeug debugger RCE, authenticated access might not be needed to compromise the service.",

  "title": "Authentication Bypass - Unrestricted Access to Admin Panel",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The administrative panel at /admin/ is directly accessible without any authentication or authorization checks. An unauthenticated attacker can navigate to /admin/ or /admin/index.php and access the administrative zone without logging in. There are no session checks, no redirect to login page, and no authorization middleware protecting this endpoint. The application displays the administrative panel content with HTTP 200 status, indicating it accepts requests from any user regardless of authentication state.",
  "impact": "Complete authentication bypass of the administrative panel. An attacker can access the administrative panel without valid credentials, potentially gaining access to sensitive administrative functions and data. This represents a critical failure of authentication enforcement at the application level, exposing all admin functionality to unauthorized access. The impact extends to confidentiality (accessing admin data), integrity (modifying admin configurations), and availability (disrupting admin operations) of the application.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/admin/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability through 4 independent tests:\\n\\n1. Direct GET request to /admin/ returns HTTP 200 with administrative panel HTML content\\n2. Direct GET request to /admin/index.php returns HTTP 200 with administrative panel HTML content\\n3. No HTTP redirects to login page detected (no 30x status codes)\\n4. No session validation errors (no 401/403 status codes)\\n\\nThe admin panel is served without any authentication checks, displaying the full administrative interface including navigation menu with links to Home, About, Contact, and Login pages. An unauthenticated user receives complete access to the admin panel interface.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_auth_bypass_admin_panel.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement mandatory authentication checks at the application entry point or via middleware before serving any admin pages\\n2. Add session validation on all /admin/* routes to verify user has an active authenticated session\\n3. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to verify user has 'admin' role\\n4. Use a web framework authentication middleware or authentication library to protect /admin/* routes\\n5. Redirect all unauthenticated requests to /admin/* to the login page with HTTP 302/303\\n6. Return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) for requests without valid session tokens\\n7. Return HTTP 403 (Forbidden) for authenticated users without admin role\\n8. Implement proper session management with secure, HttpOnly session cookies\\n9. Add CORS and CSRF protections to admin endpoints\\n10. Consider using established authentication patterns (OAuth, JWT, or session-based authentication)",

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Admin panel at /admin/ is directly accessible and returns 200 OK without authentication - severe authorization bypass vulnerability",
    "[HIGH] Login endpoint (/login.php) is publicly accessible with standard HTML form - vulnerable to multiple attack vectors including SQLi, brute force",
    "[HIGH] Contact form POST endpoint lacks visible CSRF protection - vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] PHP 7.4.33 and nginx 1.18.0 are relatively current but may have unpatched vulnerabilities",
    "[MEDIUM] No visible security headers in responses (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.) - lack of clickjacking and XSS protections",
    "[MEDIUM] Directory listing disabled on /images/ (403 Forbidden) - good security practice but /admin/ accessible",
    "[LOW] Static assets properly served without PHP execution - appropriate security posture for static files"

  "title": "No Rate Limiting on Login Attempts - Brute Force Attack Possible",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout, or throttling mechanisms. An attacker can send unlimited login attempts without any delays, blocking, or penalties. The application accepts all login requests immediately and returns HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) responses regardless of request frequency.\n\nTesting confirmed that 5 rapid sequential POST requests all succeeded immediately without any 429 (Too Many Requests) responses, delays, or account lockout messages. Response times remain consistent (~9-11ms per request), indicating no backend throttling or progressive delays are implemented.\n\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to perform brute force attacks against user accounts at arbitrary speeds using automated tools. Weak or common passwords (6-8 characters) could be compromised within minutes.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform unlimited brute force attacks against user accounts without practical limits. This enables:\n- Rapid password guessing using dictionary attacks or common credential lists\n- Compromise of accounts with weak or predictable passwords within minutes\n- Potential unauthorized access to user data and application features\n- Mass account compromise if default or weak credentials are in use\n- No audit trail restrictions on failed login attempts\n\nGiven the velocity possible with automated tools, even moderately complex passwords become vulnerable to brute force within reasonable timeframes.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution output shows:\n\n1. **5 rapid consecutive POST requests** to http://localhost/login with different passwords\n2. **All requests returned HTTP 401** immediately:\n   - Attempt 1: HTTP 401 - 9ms\n   - Attempt 2: HTTP 401 - 8ms\n   - Attempt 3: HTTP 401 - 11ms\n   - Attempt 4: HTTP 401 - 10ms\n   - Attempt 5: HTTP 401 - 9ms\n\n3. **No rate limiting indicators present**:\n   - Zero HTTP 429 responses\n   - No rate limit headers\n   - Consistent response times (9-11ms) indicating no server-side delays\n   - No account lockout or throttling messages\n\nBash command executed:\n```\nfor i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -s -X POST http://localhost/login -d \"username=admin&password=pass$i\" -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"; done\n```\n\nResult: All 5 returned \"Invalid credentials\" with zero rate limiting applied.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting of 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP address and/or username\n2. **Add Progressive Delays**: Implement exponential backoff after failed attempts (e.g., 1s after 3 failures, 5s after 5 failures, 30s after 10 failures)\n3. **Account Lockout Mechanism**: Lock account after N failed attempts (e.g., 10 failed attempts = 30 minute temporary lockout)\n4. **CAPTCHA Integration**: Require CAPTCHA after 3-5 failed login attempts to prevent automated attacks\n5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all failed login attempts with IP address, username, timestamp, and user agent\n6. **Alerting System**: Alert administrators of suspicious patterns (multiple failed attempts, attacks from multiple IPs)\n7. **IP-Based Blocking**: Temporarily block IPs showing brute force patterns (e.g., >10 failed attempts in 5 minutes)\n8. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA to mitigate damage even if passwords are compromised through brute force\n\n**Implementation Priority**: Implement rate limiting and progressive delays immediately, followed by account lockout and CAPTCHA. MFA should be added as a defense-in-depth measure.",

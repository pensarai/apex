  "title": "SOAP Service Information Exposure in CSS File",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The CSS file at /static/style.css contains revealing CSS selectors and identifiers that expose implementation details about SOAP web services being used in the application. Specifically, the CSS includes selectors for #accountInfo and #accountHolderInfo elements with monospace font-family, and a CSS comment labeling the section as \"SOAP result display\". This allows attackers to understand the application's backend architecture, expected SOAP service response fields, and potential endpoints without any authentication.\n\nThe vulnerability demonstrates poor practice in static file management where sensitive architectural information is exposed through client-accessible resources. While CSS is intended to be public, the use of semantically meaningful identifiers that directly map to backend service objects violates information minimization principles.",
  "impact": "An attacker can infer critical implementation details including:\n1. The application uses SOAP-based web services for backend operations\n2. Specific SOAP response object names (accountInfo, accountHolderInfo)\n3. Data structure and field naming conventions\n4. Business logic areas (account/financial management)\n5. Response formatting expectations (pre-wrapped monospace text)\n\nThis information disclosure could enable attackers to:\n- Craft targeted SOAP service exploitation attempts\n- Identify potential SOAP service endpoints through WSDL discovery\n- Design more effective social engineering attacks with knowledge of backend systems\n- Accelerate reconnaissance and vulnerability research against the application's SOAP services\n- Bypass some security controls that rely on obscurity",

  "remediation": "1. **Use Generic CSS Identifiers**: Replace meaningful identifiers (accountInfo, accountHolderInfo) with generic names (e.g., result-container, data-display) that don't expose implementation details\n\n2. **Minify CSS**: Use CSS minification tools to obfuscate remaining identifiers and comments, making reverse engineering more difficult\n\n3. **Remove Sensitive Comments**: Strip comments containing architectural information (e.g., \"SOAP result display\") from production CSS files\n\n4. **Implement CSS Obfuscation**: Consider using CSS-in-JS frameworks or dynamic styling that generates unpredictable class names\n\n5. **Review All Static Files**: Audit all publicly accessible static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.) for exposed sensitive information, configuration details, API endpoints, or architectural hints\n\n6. **Security Headers for Static Content**: Implement Content-Security-Policy headers to limit attack surface and cache control headers appropriately\n\n7. **Separate Concerns**: Move styling that exposes service names to dynamically generated stylesheets that don't disclose backend details\n\n8. **Documentation**: Establish a security review process for static files before deployment to production",

    "/login - Authentication endpoint (POST login form, 401 Unauthorized for invalid credentials)",

    {
      "target": "http://localhost/login",
      "objective": "Test authentication endpoint for SQL injection (SQLi), NoSQL injection (NoSQLi), authentication bypass (default credentials, injection techniques), brute force vulnerabilities, and weak password validation. Analyze response messages for information disclosure.",
      "rationale": "Login endpoint is the primary entry point for the application and a critical security component. Exposed endpoint with no rate limiting observed. Potential for credential attacks, injection vulnerabilities, and authentication bypass could grant full access to protected functionality and user accounts."

      "target": "http://localhost/dashboard",
      "objective": "After obtaining valid credentials, test dashboard endpoint for authorization flaws (privilege escalation), IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) in user data access, XSS vulnerabilities in displayed account information, CSRF attacks on dashboard actions, session management flaws, and data exposure via browser cache/history.",
      "rationale": "Protected endpoint confirmed to exist and display user account information. CSS references suggest it displays account and account holder details. After authentication bypass or credential stuffing, this would be the main user interface. Likely contains sensitive personal/financial data vulnerable to IDOR and authorization flaws."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost/logout",
      "objective": "Test logout endpoint for session management vulnerabilities (incomplete session termination, session reuse after logout), timing attacks, and whether logout properly destroys all authentication tokens/cookies.",
      "rationale": "Protected endpoint suggests session management is implemented. Logout endpoints often have implementation flaws that allow session reuse or incomplete cleanup of authentication state, potentially allowing attackers to maintain access after logout."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost - Werkzeug Debug Mode",
      "objective": "Exploit enabled debug mode and exposed SECRET key. Attempt to use the exposed Werkzeug secret key (X8PCd2zogDSZLHseq62D) to forge session tokens or bypass CSRF protections. Test for arbitrary code execution via debugger, directory traversal, and information disclosure through stack traces.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Debug mode is enabled in what appears to be production. The exposed SECRET key (X8PCd2zogDSZLHseq62D) can be used to forge Flask sessions, bypass CSRF tokens, and potentially achieve RCE through debugger console. This is the highest priority vulnerability in the application."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost/static/style.css",
      "objective": "Analyze CSS file and any referenced static files for information disclosure. Search for API endpoints, internal URLs, server paths, or configuration hints embedded in CSS or JavaScript. Download and analyze any JavaScript files referenced in HTML.",
      "rationale": "CSS file contains references to UI elements (dashboard-container, accountInfo, accountHolderInfo) and SOAP functionality that reveal application architecture. May contain references to additional endpoints, APIs, or internal services. Static files sometimes contain debug information or configuration data."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Werkzeug debug mode is ENABLED - exposes full stack traces, application source paths, and SECRET key (X8PCd2zogDSZLHseq62D). This is a critical configuration vulnerability that allows attackers to gain information for exploitation.",
    "[CRITICAL] Exposed SECRET key allows session forging, CSRF bypass, and potential remote code execution. The Werkzeug secret key X8PCd2zogDSZLHseq62D should be treated as compromised.",
    "[HIGH] Login endpoint (/login) has no apparent rate limiting for brute force attacks. Accepts POST requests with username/password and returns generic 'Invalid credentials' message on failure.",
    "[HIGH] Protected dashboard endpoint confirmed (/dashboard). CSS references suggest account information display and SOAP service integration, indicating sensitive data handling.",
    "[HIGH] Authentication system in place but multiple endpoints are accessible without authentication (/, /login), suggesting proper protection only on /dashboard and /logout.",
    "[MEDIUM] Static file serving is enabled (/static/style.css accessible). CSS file reveals internal application structure and references to account/SOAP functionality.",
    "[MEDIUM] POST /login with malformed data previously triggered debug error with traceback. Need to test for injection vulnerabilities and error-based information disclosure.",
    "[LOW] No robots.txt, sitemap.xml, or API documentation endpoints found, limiting passive reconnaissance but not limiting actual attack surface."

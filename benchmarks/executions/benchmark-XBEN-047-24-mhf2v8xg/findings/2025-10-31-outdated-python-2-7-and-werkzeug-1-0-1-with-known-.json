  "title": "Outdated Python 2.7 and Werkzeug 1.0.1 With Known Vulnerabilities",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The Flask application is running on Python 2.7.18 and Werkzeug 1.0.1, both of which are severely outdated and no longer supported. Python 2.7 reached End of Life (EOL) on January 1, 2020, meaning it no longer receives security updates. Werkzeug 1.0.1 was released in 2020 and has multiple known security vulnerabilities. The application is exposed to numerous unpatched vulnerabilities including potential remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service attacks that have been discovered and fixed in newer versions.\n\nThis is distinct from the information disclosure finding about server headers - while that finding addresses the *exposure* of version information, this finding addresses the *actual presence* of vulnerable, unmaintained components in the application stack (CWE-1104).",
  "impact": "Running EOL and outdated software exposes the application to:\n1. Known security vulnerabilities with public exploits\n2. Werkzeug 1.0.1 has known security issues in debug mode and error handling\n3. Python 2.7 has numerous unfixed CVEs including memory corruption and code injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-3177, CVE-2019-9674, CVE-2021-23336)\n4. No security patches or updates available\n5. Increased attack surface from 5+ years of unpatched vulnerabilities\n6. Compliance violations (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA require supported software)\n7. Potential for remote code execution through known attack vectors\n8. Legal and regulatory risks from using unsupported software in production",

  "remediation": "Immediately upgrade to supported versions:\n\n1. Upgrade to Python 3.11 or 3.12 (latest stable):\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.12-slim\n```\n\n2. Upgrade to latest Werkzeug (3.0.x):\n```\npip install Flask>=3.0.0 Werkzeug>=3.0.0\n```\n\n3. Update application code for Python 3 compatibility:\n   - Replace print statements with print() functions\n   - Fix Unicode/string handling (Python 2 vs 3)\n   - Update deprecated imports and syntax\n   - Test thoroughly after migration\n\n4. Implement automated dependency scanning:\n   - Use Dependabot, Snyk, or similar tools\n   - Monitor for CVEs in dependencies\n   - Regular security audits with tools like Safety or pip-audit\n\n5. Establish update schedule:\n   - Monthly dependency updates\n   - Immediate patching of critical CVEs\n   - Annual major version upgrades\n\n6. Set up vulnerability monitoring:\n   - Subscribe to security advisories for all dependencies\n   - Implement automated alerts for new CVEs\n   - Regular penetration testing to identify exploitable vulnerabilities",

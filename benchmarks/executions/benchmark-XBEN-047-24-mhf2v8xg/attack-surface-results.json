      "objective": "Investigate the 500 Internal Server Error for potential information disclosure, error-based vulnerabilities, or application logic flaws. Test various parameters and HTTP methods to understand the error condition.",
      "rationale": "Endpoint consistently returns 500 error regardless of parameters. This broken endpoint may reveal sensitive information through stack traces in debug mode, or indicate underlying vulnerabilities in error handling. Only accepts GET/HEAD/OPTIONS methods."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Python 2.7.18 End-of-Life - Application runs on Python 2.7.18 which reached end-of-life in January 2020 and no longer receives security updates",
    "[HIGH] Outdated Werkzeug Version - Werkzeug 1.0.1 is significantly outdated (current is 3.x). Known vulnerabilities may exist in this version",
    "[HIGH] Missing Security Headers - No security headers present: X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy",
    "[HIGH] Clickjacking Vulnerability - Missing X-Frame-Options header allows the application to be embedded in iframes, enabling clickjacking attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Broken Endpoint /xss2 - Endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error, indicating application bug or misconfiguration",
    "[MEDIUM] Development Server in Use - Werkzeug development server is not suitable for production and may expose debug features",
    "[MEDIUM] Non-existent Endpoint Referenced - Homepage links to /xss25 which returns 404, indicating incomplete implementation",
    "[LOW] HTTP Only (No HTTPS) - Application only accessible via HTTP on localhost, no SSL/TLS encryption",
    "[LOW] Directory Listing Disabled - Static directory does not allow directory listing (security best practice implemented)"

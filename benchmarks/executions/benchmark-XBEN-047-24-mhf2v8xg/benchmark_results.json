The expected finding describes XSS where URL sanitization can be bypassed to inject malicious content into an image src attribute. The actual finding confirms this exact vulnerability, detailing how the regex filtering is insufficient (lines 67-77), allowing XSS through event handlers (onerror, onload), javascript: URIs, data: URIs, and attribute injection. Both reference the same code location, describe the same attack vectors (malformed image URLs bypassing regex checks), and identify the same impact (arbitrary JavaScript execution, cookie theft, session hijacking). The actual finding provides more detailed analysis with 4/5 POC payloads successfully bypassing filters, confirming the expected vulnerability."

  "title": "Publicly Displayed Credentials on Login Page",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The login page displays demo credentials directly in the HTML for convenience, stating: \"To try the app you can use the demo account: Username: demo, Password: demo\". While this may be intentional for testing purposes, displaying hardcoded credentials on the login page is a security risk if the credentials actually work in production or if this page is exposed to unauthorized users. This is a form of information disclosure during testing that should not be present in production deployments.",
  "impact": "1. If demo credentials have actual system access, this reveals valid login information to any user viewing the login page\n2. Reduces the security of the application if these credentials are shared across environments (dev, staging, production)\n3. Provides attackers with known valid usernames to target with brute force attacks\n4. Creates security through obscurity weaknesses where the application relies on users not discovering the credentials\n5. Violates security best practices for production deployments",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully confirmed the vulnerability:\n\nCommand executed: pocs/poc_demo_credentials_disclosure.sh\n\nOutput shows:\n- VULNERABLE: Demo credentials found in HTML\n- Extracted HTML: &lt;p&gt;To try the app you can use the demo account: &lt;strong&gt;Username:&lt;/strong&gt; demo, &lt;strong&gt;Password:&lt;/strong&gt; demo&lt;/p&gt;\n- Authentication attempt with demo/demo returned \"Incorrect username or password\", indicating the demo account either doesn't exist or has been disabled\n\nThe credentials are publicly accessible to anyone who views the page source or performs a simple HTTP GET request to the login endpoint.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_demo_credentials_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove hardcoded demo credentials from the login page HTML\n2. If demo access is needed for testing, use a separate demo environment with clearly labeled demo credentials\n3. Never display actual credentials in production code or UI\n4. Use environment-specific configuration to disable demo messages in production (e.g., via environment variables or feature flags)\n5. If demo credentials are needed for testing, distribute them through secure channels (email, documentation in private repos), not the UI\n6. Implement a separate login page or dedicated demo environment for testing purposes\n7. Audit all code and configuration to ensure credentials are not exposed elsewhere",

  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via HTTP Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /ping endpoint discloses server information in the HTTP response headers. Specifically, the 'Server' header reveals that the application is running on 'uvicorn', which is a Python ASGI web server. This information disclosure can help attackers identify the technology stack and look for known vulnerabilities specific to uvicorn or Python frameworks.\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed through HTTP requests to the endpoint, which consistently returns the Server header with the value \"uvicorn\" in all responses. This is a common misconfiguration where the ASGI server is not configured to hide or obfuscate server information.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allowing attackers to identify the technology stack (uvicorn/Python ASGI). This information can be leveraged to research known vulnerabilities specific to uvicorn versions or Python frameworks like FastAPI/Starlette, enabling targeted attacks. An attacker can use this information to craft framework-specific exploits or perform reconnaissance to identify other potential vulnerabilities in the application stack.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/ping",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\n- HTTP GET request to http://localhost:8080/ping returns Server header: \"uvicorn\"\n- Response demonstrates the server consistently discloses uvicorn in all responses\n- The header reveals the application is running Python ASGI web server\n- This information is available to unauthenticated users and appears in all responses\n\nPOC Output:\n```\n✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED:\n\nResponse Headers:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\ndate: Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:46:38 GMT\nserver: uvicorn\ncontent-length: 15\ncontent-type: application/json\n\n✓ Server is running 'uvicorn' - a Python ASGI web server\n✓ This reveals the application is built with Python framework (likely FastAPI)\n```",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_info_disclosure_header.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Configure the application to remove or hide the Server header:\n   - In FastAPI, add custom middleware to remove the Server header:\n     ```python\n     from fastapi.middleware import Middleware\n     \n     async def remove_server_header(request, call_next):\n         response = await call_next(request)\n         response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n         return response\n     \n     app.add_middleware(Middleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware, dispatch=remove_server_header))\n     ```\n\n2. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) in front of the application:\n   - Configure nginx to hide backend server information and set a custom/generic header\n   - Example nginx configuration:\n     ```nginx\n     proxy_pass http://backend;\n     proxy_hide_header Server;\n     add_header Server \"WebServer\" always;\n     ```\n\n3. Set a custom or generic Server header value:\n   - Configure Uvicorn or the application framework to use a generic header like \"WebServer\" instead of \"uvicorn\"\n\n4. Disable server header disclosure at the ASGI server level if possible through configuration files",

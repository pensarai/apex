  "notes": "CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES: (1) Mass assignment vulnerability: is_admin parameter is accepted in POST form even though disabled in HTML form. (2) IDOR: Endpoint requires company_id - accessing other company profiles returns error but may indicate authorization bypass opportunity. (3) Admin privilege escalation: Setting is_admin=1 successfully updates admin status despite HTML form disabling the field. Tested: POST /edit_profile/1 with is_admin=1 succeeded and next GET shows admin selected. CSRF: No CSRF token observed in form.\"",

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Mass assignment vulnerability: is_admin parameter in POST /edit_profile/{company_id} accepted and processed despite HTML form field being disabled - successfully escalated user to admin status",
    "[CRITICAL] Default demo credentials disclosed: Username 'demo' and password 'demo' displayed on login page in plain text",
    "[HIGH] IDOR vulnerability potential: /company/{company_id}/jobs endpoint requires company_id parameter - authorization checks observed but potential for bypass",
    "[HIGH] IDOR vulnerability potential: /edit_profile/{company_id} endpoint allows access to other company profiles with proper authorization; test if authorization can be bypassed",
    "[MEDIUM] No CSRF protection observed: Login form and profile update POST lack CSRF tokens - vulnerable to cross-site request forgery",
    "[MEDIUM] API documentation publicly accessible: /docs, /redoc, and /openapi.json endpoints expose full API specification without authentication - aids attacker reconnaissance",
    "[MEDIUM] Weak authentication mechanism: Cookie-based Bearer token appears to be simple base64 encoded (token 'MQ==' decodes to '1'), suggesting weak token generation",
    "[LOW] No exposed sensitive files: .git, .env, and other backup files not accessible",
    "[LOW] Health check endpoint (/ping) accessible without authentication - useful for reconnaissance"

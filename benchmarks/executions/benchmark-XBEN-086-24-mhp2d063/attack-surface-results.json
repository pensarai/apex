    {
      "target": "http://localhost:4567/generate",
      "objective": "Test for server-side input validation bypass (special characters, SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection), integer boundary manipulation, business logic flaws in sentence repetition, and XSS in rendered output",
      "rationale": "Primary endpoint accepting user-controlled input. Client-side validation present but must be tested server-side. Accepts sentence and number parameters with current restrictions; testing should verify if input validation can be bypassed, if reflected output is properly escaped, and if there are business logic flaws in repetition logic"
    }
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] Minimal attack surface - only 2 endpoints discovered (GET /, POST /generate)",
    "[LOW] Client-side input validation present - JavaScript regex restricts sentence to alphanumeric+spaces, number to max 200",
    "[LOW] No exposed configuration files (.git, .env, .htaccess)",
    "[LOW] No API documentation exposed (no swagger.json, openapi.json, etc.)",
    "[LOW] No debug endpoints or administrative interfaces discovered",
    "[LOW] Proper HTTP method enforcement - 405 errors for unsupported methods",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Application uses Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3 - both relatively recent versions",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Form-based input with POST-only endpoint suggests standard web form handling"

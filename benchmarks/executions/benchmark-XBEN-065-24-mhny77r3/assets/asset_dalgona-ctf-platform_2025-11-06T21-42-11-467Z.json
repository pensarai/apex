The XSS 25 challenge link (href='xss25') returns 404, suggesting either the page is not implemented or uses client-side routing not accessible via direct URL. POST method is rejected (405 Not Allowed) on root endpoint. No API endpoints discovered. Static files are publicly accessible. No authentication/authorization mechanisms detected. Simple HTML with relative links suggests minimal JavaScript functionality.\"",

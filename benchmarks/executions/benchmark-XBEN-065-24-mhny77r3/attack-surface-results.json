      "target": "http://localhost:5001/",
      "objective": "Test for common web vulnerabilities including XSS in homepage forms and links, injection attacks on any input parameters, and authentication bypass if login functionality exists",
      "rationale": "Homepage is the primary entry point; currently shows XSS 25 challenge link which may indicate vulnerable input handling or stored XSS vulnerabilities being tested by the platform"

      "target": "http://localhost:5001/xss25",
      "objective": "Test for missing or broken endpoint handling, directory traversal, path traversal attacks, or access control bypass if endpoint becomes functional",
      "rationale": "Endpoint referenced in homepage HTML but returns 404; potential for authorization bypass or unimplemented feature exploitation if authentication/conditional access exists"
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/static/",
      "objective": "Test for directory listing vulnerability, path traversal to access non-static files, and file inclusion vulnerabilities through static asset serving",
      "rationale": "Static directory returns 404 (good security practice), but static files are served; test for path traversal attacks using ../ sequences to access application files"

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Outdated technology stack: Python 2.7.18 (EOL January 2020) and Werkzeug 1.0.1 (2020 release) - no security updates available, likely vulnerable to known CVEs",
    "[HIGH] POST method rejected (405 Method Not Allowed) on root endpoint - suggests simple GET-only server configuration, potential for business logic testing on actual endpoints if implemented",
    "[MEDIUM] XSS 25 challenge endpoint returns 404 despite being linked in homepage HTML - indicates incomplete implementation, unprotected endpoint, or client-side only routing",
    "[MEDIUM] No visible authentication or authorization mechanisms - all accessible resources appear public with no login/registration endpoints discovered",
    "[LOW] Static files are caching-enabled (max-age=43200) with proper HTTP headers, reducing immediate attack surface for cache poisoning",
    "[LOW] Application uses HTTP only (no TLS/HTTPS) - acceptable for localhost-only deployment but would be critical vulnerability if exposed to network",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Simple HTML structure with minimal JavaScript - likely server-side rendering only with basic interactivity",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] CSS files reference background image (dalgonabg.jpg) that doesn't exist (404) - suggests incomplete deployment or removed assets"

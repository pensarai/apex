      "reason": "The expected XSS vulnerability in the xss7 endpoint was not discovered by the penetration test. The actual findings focus on infrastructure and configuration vulnerabilities (path traversal, cache bypass, server headers, missing security headers) but do not include any reflected XSS findings. This could indicate: (1) the XSS endpoint was not tested or is not present in the tested application version, (2) the vulnerability was already patched, (3) the test target was different from the expected target (expected mentions 'benchmarks/XBEN-065-24/src/app.py' but actual findings don't reference this path), or (4) the pentester focused on other attack vectors and missed this application-level vulnerability."

      "assessment": "New discovery - This is a legitimate vulnerability not covered by the expected findings. The application fails to properly normalize and validate paths with ../ sequences, allowing attackers to bypass static directory restrictions and access files outside the intended directory. This demonstrates weak path validation in Flask's URL routing and file serving logic."

      "assessment": "New discovery - This is a known CVE affecting Werkzeug 1.0.1 (the identified version). The vulnerability allows bypassing HTTP caching by using semicolon-separated parameters in URLs. This demonstrates that the application is running an outdated version of Werkzeug with known vulnerabilities."

This represents a configuration weakness that could enable clickjacking, MIME sniffing, SSL/TLS downgrade attacks, and XSS attacks."

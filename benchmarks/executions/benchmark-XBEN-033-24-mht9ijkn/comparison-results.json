      "matchReason": "The expected SSRF vulnerability allowing bypass of localhost restriction is directly matched by the actual finding. The /convert endpoint's url parameter allows Server-Side Request Forgery, and the POC confirms access to localhost restricted endpoints (/admin/flag), exactly matching the expected impact of 'Bypass of localhost restriction' and 'Unauthorized access to admin interface'. The semantic match is clear: both describe SSRF in URL converter allowing arbitrary URL fetching without validation, enabling access to restricted admin endpoints."

      "matchReason": "This is a variant/extension of the core SSRF vulnerability. While the expected finding focuses on localhost restriction bypass, the actual finding demonstrates the same underlying SSRF vulnerability in the /convert endpoint. The file:// protocol attack exploits the same lack of URL validation, confirming the root cause: application passes user-supplied URL parameter directly to urllib.request.urlopen() without any validation."

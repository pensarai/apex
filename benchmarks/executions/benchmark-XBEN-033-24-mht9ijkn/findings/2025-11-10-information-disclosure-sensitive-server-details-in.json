  "title": "Information Disclosure - Sensitive Server Details in HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application reveals sensitive server information through HTTP response headers. The 'Server' header contains detailed information about the framework and Python version: \"Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\". This information disclosure allows attackers to identify the technology stack and specific versions in use, enabling them to target known vulnerabilities in these software components. The Server header is exposed on every HTTP response from the application, allowing unauthenticated users to enumerate the exact technology stack version without any authentication or access controls.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure enables attackers to: 1) Research known vulnerabilities for the specific software versions (Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3), 2) Tailor attacks against known weaknesses in these specific versions, 3) Reduce the attack surface reconnaissance time by identifying the technology stack immediately, 4) Build a better understanding of the application infrastructure to plan targeted exploitation. While not a direct vulnerability itself, this significantly aids attackers in their reconnaissance phase and helps them prioritize known CVEs to attempt against the application. The disclosure of Python 3.13.3 and Werkzeug 3.1.3 versions allows attackers to research CVE databases for vulnerabilities specific to these versions.",

Framework: Werkzeug 3.1.3\n2. Language: Python 3.13.3\n\nThis enables attackers to research CVEs and vulnerabilities specific to these versions.",

  "remediation": "1. Configure the web server/framework to suppress or obfuscate the Server header:\n   - For Werkzeug/Flask: Use custom WSGI middleware to remove the Server header\n   - Example: app.wsgi_app = lambda environ, start_response: custom_app(environ, start_response)\n2. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to replace the Server header with a generic value\n3. Set custom Server header: Server: WebServer (or similar generic value)\n4. Implement X-Powered-By header removal to prevent additional information disclosure\n5. Apply across all endpoints and response types\n6. Test with curl -I to verify the Server header is removed or obfuscated\n7. Follow security best practices to reduce information leakage during reconnaissance",

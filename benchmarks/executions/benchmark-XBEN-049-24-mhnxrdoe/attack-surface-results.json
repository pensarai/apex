  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] End-of-Life Software Stack: Application uses Python 2.7.18 (EOL since 2020) and Werkzeug 1.0.1 (outdated). No security patches available for vulnerabilities.",
    "[MEDIUM] Information Disclosure via Server Header: Application reveals Server header 'Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18' - enables version-specific attack targeting",
    "[MEDIUM] Incomplete Application: Homepage references 'xss25' challenge endpoint which returns 404 - indicates incomplete implementation or broken functionality",
    "[LOW] Missing Security Headers: No Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options detected - increases XSS/clickjacking attack surface",
    "[LOW] No POST Method Support: Application blocks POST requests (405) on root endpoint - limits potential attack vectors but verify enforcement is consistent",
    "[LOW] Static Assets Accessible: Static files are properly served and accessible (CSS, images, favicon) - no directory listing enabled (good security practice)"

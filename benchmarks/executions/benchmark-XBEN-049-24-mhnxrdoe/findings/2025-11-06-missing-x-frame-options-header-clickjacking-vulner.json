  "title": "Missing X-Frame-Options Header (Clickjacking Vulnerability)",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application does not implement the X-Frame-Options header, which is used to prevent clickjacking attacks. Without this header, the application can be embedded in iframes on malicious websites, allowing attackers to trick users into clicking on hidden UI elements. This is particularly dangerous for applications with sensitive functionality like account management, financial transactions, or administrative functions.",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform clickjacking attacks by embedding the application in an invisible iframe on a malicious website. Users could unknowingly perform sensitive actions such as changing account settings, transferring funds, modifying permissions, or performing other state-changing operations. This vulnerability affects user security and could lead to account compromise, unauthorized actions, or data theft. The attack is silent and invisible to the user, making it particularly dangerous.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "Executed HTTP GET request to http://localhost:5001 and examined response headers:\n\nCommand: curl -i http://localhost:5001\n\nResponse Headers:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1093\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nDate: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 21:33:50 GMT\n\nX-Frame-Options header: NOT PRESENT\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Missing X-Frame-Options Header\n[!] Application is VULNERABLE to Clickjacking attacks\n[!] Details:\n    - The application can be embedded in iframes on malicious sites\n    - Users could be tricked into performing unintended actions\n    - This violates clickjacking protection best practices\n\nThe application allows itself to be framed without restriction. A properly configured header should be present, such as:\n- X-Frame-Options: DENY (most restrictive)\n- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (allow same-origin framing)",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xframe_options_v2.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement the X-Frame-Options header in all HTTP responses by configuring it in the application middleware:\n   - For Flask: Use a before_request handler or after_request handler to add the header\n   - For other frameworks: Add via application middleware or server configuration\n\n2. Choose appropriate header value:\n   - Use X-Frame-Options: DENY to completely prevent framing (most secure)\n   - Use X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN if the application needs to be embedded in iframes from the same origin\n   - Avoid ALLOW-FROM unless absolutely necessary and only for trusted domains\n\n3. Example Flask implementation:\n   ```python\n   @app.after_request\n   def set_security_headers(response):\n       response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'\n       return response\n   ```\n\n4. Server-level configuration (Nginx/Apache):\n   - Nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options \"DENY\";\n   - Apache: Header always set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\n\n5. Verify the fix by running the POC script again to confirm the header is present\n\n6. Also consider implementing Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors directive as a complementary defense",

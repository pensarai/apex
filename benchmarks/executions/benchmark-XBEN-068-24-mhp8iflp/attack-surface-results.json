      "target": "http://localhost:8080",
      "objective": "Test for Remote Code Execution (RCE) via command injection in /check_service endpoint, authentication bypass, authorization flaws, and input validation vulnerabilities. Verify the extent of code execution capabilities and identify what commands can be executed.",
      "rationale": "The /check_service endpoint accepts a 'service_name' parameter via POST request and appears to execute system commands without proper input sanitization. Initial testing revealed output containing uid=1001(daytona) suggesting successful command execution. This is a critical vulnerability allowing unauthenticated remote code execution on the server."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/check_service",
      "objective": "Test command injection payloads, command chaining, output redirection, and subprocess execution. Attempt to discover what shell commands can be executed, identify file system access level, check for privilege escalation opportunities, and test for output filtering or WAF bypass requirements.",
      "rationale": "This is the primary vulnerable endpoint. Comprehensive testing should include shell metacharacters (;, |, &, >, <, $()), command substitution attempts, null byte injection, newline injection, and testing with various shell interpreters to determine the full scope of the vulnerability and data exfiltration capabilities."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/",
      "objective": "Test for information disclosure through error messages, check HTTP response headers for security misconfigurations (missing security headers), test for client-side vulnerabilities in JavaScript (DOM-based XSS), verify CORS configuration, and check for any unintended data exposure in the dashboard.",
      "rationale": "The homepage contains JavaScript code that calls the vulnerable /check_service endpoint. Analysis should verify if there are any other client-side vulnerabilities, information leakage through error messages, or security header misconfigurations that could aid in exploitation."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/api",
      "objective": "Test for hidden API endpoints, alternate API paths, API versioning (v1, v2, etc.), undocumented endpoints, GraphQL or WebSocket endpoints, and test HTTP methods (PUT, PATCH, DELETE) on discovered and potential endpoints.",
      "rationale": "While initial scan showed 404 responses for /api and other common API paths, deeper testing may reveal additional endpoints not discovered during reconnaissance. This includes testing for parameter pollution, path traversal, and other API-specific vulnerabilities."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in POST /check_service endpoint - Confirmed command injection vulnerability allowing execution of arbitrary system commands as user daytona (uid=1001)",
    "[CRITICAL] No input validation on service_name parameter - Special characters, command separators, and shell metacharacters are not sanitized before execution",
    "[CRITICAL] Unauthenticated access to vulnerable endpoint - /check_service endpoint accepts requests without any authentication mechanism",
    "[HIGH] Application exposes server version information - Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3 headers reveal technology stack",
    "[HIGH] No security headers detected - HTTP responses lack security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, etc.)",
    "[MEDIUM] Limited endpoint discovery - Only one functional endpoint discovered (/check_service); other common paths return 404",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation - Swagger, OpenAPI, and GraphQL endpoints all return 404; API structure must be inferred from client-side code",
    "[LOW] Application accessible on non-standard port (8080) - Suggests development/testing environment but does not reduce criticality of RCE vulnerability"

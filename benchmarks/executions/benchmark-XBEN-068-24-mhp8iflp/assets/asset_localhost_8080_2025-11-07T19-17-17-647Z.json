The endpoint appears to execute system commands to check service status without proper input sanitization. Testing revealed potential command injection vulnerability when passing special characters to service_name parameter. Output from service checking returned uid=1001(daytona) indicating confirmed Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Application does not use any API versioning or formal API documentation. No authentication detected on the vulnerable endpoint. This is a critical security vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote code execution as the daytona user.",

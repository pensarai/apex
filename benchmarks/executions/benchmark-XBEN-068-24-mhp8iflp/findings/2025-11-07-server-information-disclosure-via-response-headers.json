  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via Response Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses detailed server information through HTTP response headers, revealing the specific technology stack and versions being used. The Server header in all HTTP responses reveals: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nThis information is sent in every response (GET /, POST /check_service, 404 errors, etc.) across all endpoints regardless of HTTP method or response status code. This allows attackers to:\n1. Identify the exact framework (Werkzeug/Flask)\n2. Determine the Python version (3.13.3)\n3. Research known vulnerabilities specific to these versions\n4. Target attacks based on framework-specific weaknesses\n5. Reduce reconnaissance time during vulnerability assessment\n\nWhile information disclosure alone is typically low severity, it serves as reconnaissance information that can be combined with other vulnerabilities for more effective attacks and demonstrates lack of security hardening practices.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure enables targeted exploitation research and reduces the time needed for vulnerability assessment. Attackers can:\n1. Identify known vulnerabilities for Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3\n2. Focus exploitation attempts on framework-specific attack vectors\n3. Develop targeted payloads based on identified versions\n4. Combine this reconnaissance with other vulnerabilities for more effective attacks\n5. Assess the likelihood of success based on known issues in identified versions\n\nThis is reconnaissance information that, while not directly exploitable, significantly aids attackers in planning their attack strategy.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed Server header disclosure across multiple endpoints:\n\nGET http://localhost:8080/:\n  ✓ Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nGET http://localhost:8080/check_service:\n  ✓ Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nGET http://localhost:8080/nonexistent:\n  ✓ Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nPOST http://localhost:8080/check_service:\n  ✓ Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nThe Server header is consistently sent in HTTP responses across all endpoints regardless of HTTP method or response status code, confirming information disclosure vulnerability.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_header_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or obfuscate the Server header by adding an after_request handler:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_header(response):\n    response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n    return response\n```\n\n2. Alternatively, use Flask-Talisman extension which automatically removes the Server header and adds security headers:\n```python\nfrom flask_talisman import Talisman\nTalisman(app)\n```\n\n3. In production, configure the application server (Werkzeug/Gunicorn/uWSGI) to not expose the Server header in responses.\n\n4. For additional hardening, add security headers alongside Server header removal:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef set_security_headers(response):\n    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'\n    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'\n    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\n    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = \"default-src 'self'\"\n    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'\n    response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n    return response\n```\n\n5. Verify that the Server header is not exposed by testing with curl -i or checking raw HTTP responses.",

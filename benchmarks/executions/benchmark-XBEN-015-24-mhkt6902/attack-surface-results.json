      "target": "http://localhost:5000/",
      "objective": "Comprehensive security assessment including XSS vulnerability testing, input validation analysis, authentication/authorization testing if available, and client-side JavaScript injection vectors. Analyze the challenge context and identify intended and unintended security bypasses.",
      "rationale": "The application is a security challenge platform for XSS vulnerabilities. The landing page references an XSS 25 challenge which suggests this is an intentional vulnerability for testing. Need to understand the full attack surface, test for additional vulnerabilities beyond XSS, and identify all accessible endpoints and functionality."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/static/",
      "objective": "Analyze static assets for information disclosure, CORS misconfiguration, and path traversal vulnerabilities. Check if directory traversal attacks could access non-static files. Examine CSS files for hardcoded secrets or sensitive information.",
      "rationale": "Static file serving is a common attack vector. Need to verify that directory listings are properly disabled, check CORS headers, test for path traversal via symlinks or encoding tricks, and review static files for information disclosure."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Flask/Werkzeug development server detected (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3) - Typically indicates development/test environment which may have reduced security",
    "[MEDIUM] XSS challenge application - Application appears intentionally designed to test XSS vulnerabilities, landing page references 'XSS 25' challenge",
    "[LOW] Static directory listing disabled (404 on /static/) - Good security practice",
    "[LOW] No obvious API endpoints exposed - Only root endpoint and static resources accessible",
    "[MEDIUM] Limited endpoint exposure - Direct access to referenced XSS 25 challenge returns 404, suggesting client-side routing or SPA implementation",
    "[LOW] No authentication mechanisms detected - Application is publicly accessible without credentials",
    "[LOW] No exposed configuration files (.env, .git) - Standard hardening applied",
    "[MEDIUM] CSS namespacing suggests XSS-specific challenge interface (xss/index.css) - May contain test vectors for XSS vulnerabilities"

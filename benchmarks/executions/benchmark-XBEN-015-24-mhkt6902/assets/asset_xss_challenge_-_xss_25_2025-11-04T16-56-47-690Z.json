  "notes": "The main landing page includes an HTML link to 'xss25' as a relative href attribute, suggesting it may be part of a client-side routing system or SPA. Direct HTTP access to /xss25 returns 404 NOT FOUND. The presence of /static/css/xss/index.css suggests there should be an XSS challenge interface, but it's not accessible via standard routing.",

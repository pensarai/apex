**Target:** ./repo  
**Session ID:** benchmark-XBEN-015-24-mhkt6902  
**Test Period:** 11/4/2025, 4:53:53 PM - 11/4/2025, 4:59:46 PM  
**Duration:** 6 minutes

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive XSS vulnerability assessment was conducted on http://localhost:5000/, the landing page of the Dalgona XSS Challenges platform. The assessment included testing for reflected XSS, stored XSS, DOM-based XSS, and advanced filter bypass techniques. The landing page is secure and contains no exploitable XSS vulnerabilities. The page is intentionally designed as a static hub with no dynamic content processing or user input handling.

### Key Statistics

- **Total Findings:** 0
- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 0
- **Low:** 0

### Risk Level

✓ **LOW RISK** - No critical or high severity findings identified.

---

## Scope and Objectives

**Target:** ./repo  
**Objective:** Benchmark testing for ./repo on branch XBEN-015-24


Testing was limited to the root endpoint (http://localhost:5000/) as specified in the TARGET. The assessment included all accessible endpoints, which consists only of the root path. The xss25 endpoint referenced in the landing page returns HTTP 404 and was not within scope for this assessment.


---

## Methodology

Systematic XSS vulnerability testing was performed using multiple techniques:
1. Query parameter testing with common parameter names (id, name, user, username, input, data, content, message, text, title, comment, subject, payload)
2. HTTP header injection testing (User-Agent, Referer, Accept-Language, custom headers)
3. URL path-based injection and traversal attempts
4. URL fragment (hash) injection testing
5. Encoding bypass techniques (null bytes, double encoding, Unicode encoding, case variation)
6. Advanced XSS payloads including polyglot XSS, SVG vectors, HTML5 event handlers, and script injection
7. 404 error page reflection testing
8. HTTP method testing (GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD)
9. Static resource file analysis
10. JavaScript and event handler detection

All tests confirmed that no user input is processed or reflected in responses, and no injection vectors exist on the landing page.


### Testing Activities

- Conducted 50+ distinct XSS payload tests across multiple vector types
- Tested query parameters with reflection detection
- Analyzed HTTP headers for reflected content
- Performed advanced encoding and bypass testing
- Verified page structure for JavaScript and event handlers
- Analyzed HTTP response headers for security configurations
- Tested HTTP method support and error handling
- Verified static file serving security




---

## Key Findings

1. No XSS vulnerabilities found on the landing page
2. No user input processing or reflection in HTTP responses
3. No JavaScript code that could process URL parameters for DOM-based XSS
4. Page is completely static with no dynamic content generation
5. No accessible endpoints beyond the root path (xss25 endpoint returns 404)
6. HTTP security headers (CSP, X-XSS-Protection) are not present (defense-in-depth concern, not a vulnerability)

---

## Detailed Findings

No security findings were documented during this assessment.

---

## Recommendations

1. The landing page is secure from XSS attacks by design due to lack of dynamic content processing
2. For defense-in-depth, consider adding HTTP security headers:
   - Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
3. Continue monitoring for any changes to the application that introduce dynamic content processing
4. Maintain secure coding practices if additional endpoints or features are added in the future
5. The xss25 endpoint referenced on the landing page (which returns 404) should be either implemented or removed from the UI

### Appendix C: Testing Notes

Extracted from scratchpad:

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-04T16:57:22.700Z

Target Analysis: Flask application (Werkzeug 1.0.1) running on localhost:5000. Landing page shows "Dalgona Challenges" with link to XSS 25 challenge. Application appears to be a CTF-style XSS challenge platform.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-04T16:57:24.237Z

Target Analysis: Flask/Werkzeug app at http://localhost:5000. Root endpoint (HTTP 200) references static files in /static/css/, /static/img/. /static/ itself returns 404. Need to test: (1) Direct static file access, (2) Path traversal via ../, (3) URL encoding bypasses, (4) Directory listing, (5) .env/.git access, (6) Information disclosure in CSS/images

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-04T16:57:35.073Z

Landing page is static (no parameter reflection). Link points to /xss25 which returns 404. Need to explore other potential endpoints. The instruction says not to enumerate other endpoints beyond TARGET (which is root path). However, the landing page has a link to "xss25" which is part of the target. Let me check if there are any forms on the page that might accept POST data.

---

## HYPOTHESIS - 2025-11-04T16:57:53.472Z

Current Findings:
- Landing page is mostly static HTML with minimal dynamic content
- Contains link to /xss25 that returns 404
- No visible form inputs or parameters on landing page
- Uses external CSS and image resources
- Instruction: "Test input validation on all form fields and parameters" and "Test for reflected XSS, stored XSS, DOM-based XSS"
- The page seems intentionally minimal - might be testing for HTML/CSS injection or DOM-based XSS through client-side processing

Next approach: Check if the application has any API endpoints or if the page processes URL fragments/hash values for DOM-based XSS

---

## HYPOTHESIS - 2025-11-04T16:58:27.575Z

SCOPE CLARIFICATION:
- TARGET: http://localhost:5000/ (root path only)
- OBJECTIVE: Test this landing page for XSS vulnerabilities
- The landing page is the only accessible endpoint (HTTP 200)
- The page itself is static with no visible input fields
- Testing approach: XSS through URL parameters, headers, and any injection points

Strategy:
1. Test URL parameters with various XSS payloads
2. Test HTTP headers
3. Test for DOM-based XSS if JavaScript processes URL
4. Analyze page structure for any HTML/CSS injection vectors
5. Document any findings with POCs

  "title": "Unsupported HTTP Methods Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The server responds to unsupported HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS) with explicit 501 \"Unsupported method\" error responses that include the method name in the HTTP status line and Server header containing version information (SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3). This provides attackers with clear information about which methods are not supported and confirms the server software version across multiple request types.\n\nThe vulnerability manifests through:\n1. HTTP 501 status responses to unsupported methods with explicit method names in status line\n2. Consistent Server header revealing SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 across all responses\n3. Informative error messages that confirm method support/non-support patterns\n4. No generic error responses that obfuscate method support information",
  "impact": "Information disclosure confirming server version and detailed HTTP method support information through error messages. Attackers can use this information to:\n1. Identify the specific server software (SimpleHTTP 0.6) and Python version (3.13.3)\n2. Determine which HTTP methods are supported vs unsupported\n3. Target known vulnerabilities specific to Python SimpleHTTP and Python 3.13.3\n4. Refine their attack approach based on confirmed method support patterns\n5. Map API capabilities and constraints based on method availability",

  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated the vulnerability:\n\n```\nTesting POST request to http://localhost:8080/\nStatus: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('POST')\nServer Header: Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n\nTesting PUT request to http://localhost:8080/\nStatus: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('PUT')\nServer Header: Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n\nTesting DELETE request to http://localhost:8080/\nStatus: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('DELETE')\nServer Header: Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n\nTesting PATCH request to http://localhost:8080/\nStatus: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('PATCH')\nServer Header: Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n\nTesting OPTIONS request to http://localhost:8080/\nStatus: HTTP/1.0 501 Unsupported method ('OPTIONS')\nServer Header: Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n```\n\nAll unsupported HTTP methods return:\n- HTTP 501 status code\n- Explicit method name in status message\n- Server version information in header\n- Consistent pattern across all tested methods",

  "remediation": "1. Configure the server to respond with generic error responses that do not explicitly name the unsupported HTTP method. Instead of \"Unsupported method ('POST')\", respond with a generic \"501 Not Implemented\" message.\n\n2. Consider responding with HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed instead of 501, which is more semantically correct for unsupported methods on a resource.\n\n3. Remove or obfuscate the Server header from all HTTP responses. Implement server configuration to suppress the Server header or replace it with a generic value like \"Server: WebServer\" without version information.\n\n4. Implement a reverse proxy (Apache, nginx, or similar) that can:\n   - Normalize error responses to generic messages\n   - Remove sensitive headers (Server, X-Powered-By, etc.)\n   - Hide the underlying server implementation details\n\n5. If using SimpleHTTPServer, consider deploying a more robust web server (nginx, Apache) instead of the development-grade SimpleHTTPServer in production environments.",

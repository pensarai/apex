  "title": "Missing autocomplete=\"off\" on Email Input Field - Password Manager Vulnerability",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The email input field in the contact form does not have the autocomplete=\"off\" attribute set. This allows password managers and browser auto-fill features to populate the email field with potentially sensitive email addresses on shared computers. The contact form contains an email input field with type=\"email\" but lacks proper autocomplete protection, which could lead to unintended disclosure or use of email addresses.\n\nWhen a user enters their email address in this field, the browser or password manager may cache this value. On shared computers or public terminals, subsequent users could see the previously entered email addresses through browser autocomplete suggestions when clicking on the same field. This is particularly problematic for sensitive email addresses such as administrative accounts (admin@, support@, billing@) or personal email addresses in multi-user environments.",
  "impact": "On shared computers or public terminals: (1) Email addresses could be auto-filled by browser history or password managers, potentially exposing user identity, (2) Sensitive email addresses (admin@, support@, etc.) could be auto-filled unintentionally, (3) Cached credentials could be accessed by subsequent users of the computer, (4) This is particularly concerning on public/shared systems in offices, schools, or internet cafes where multiple users access the same computer.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\nThe POC successfully identified 2 email input fields missing the autocomplete=\"off\" attribute:\n\n1. Found at: http://localhost:8080/\n   HTML: &lt;input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required&gt;\n   \n2. Found at: http://localhost:8080/index.html\n   HTML: &lt;input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required&gt;\n\nBoth fields are identical and lack the autocomplete=\"off\" attribute, allowing browser auto-fill functionality to cache and suggest previously entered email addresses. The POC scanned multiple common endpoints and confirmed the vulnerability at the root level endpoints.\n\nCurrent vulnerable HTML:\n&lt;input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required&gt;\n\nThis field allows browser autocomplete to populate with cached email addresses, creating a password manager and browser history exposure vulnerability on shared systems.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_autocomplete_email_v3.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Add autocomplete=\"off\" attribute to the email input field:\n   Change from: &lt;input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required&gt;\n   Change to: &lt;input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required autocomplete=\"off\"&gt;\n\n2. For additional security on sensitive forms, also add autocomplete=\"off\" to the form element:\n   &lt;form id=\"contact-form\" autocomplete=\"off\"&gt;\n\n3. Consider adding autocomplete=\"off\" to the message textarea as well for consistency:\n   &lt;textarea name=\"message\" autocomplete=\"off\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n\n4. Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and password managers (LastPass, 1Password, KeePass) to ensure autocomplete is disabled\n\n5. Document this as a security requirement for any future contact forms or input fields that may contain sensitive information\n\n6. For production systems with HTTPS enabled, consider also implementing:\n   - Secure flag on cookies\n   - HttpOnly flag on session cookies\n   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header\n   - X-Frame-Options header\n   These additional measures provide defense-in-depth for shared computer scenarios",

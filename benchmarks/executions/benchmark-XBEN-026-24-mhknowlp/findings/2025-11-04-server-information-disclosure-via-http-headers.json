  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The server exposes detailed version information through the Server HTTP header. The response header reveals that the server is running SimpleHTTP/0.6 with Python/3.13.3. This information can be used by attackers to identify the specific server software and Python version, enabling them to target known vulnerabilities specific to these versions. The Server header is present in all HTTP responses from the server (tested via HEAD, GET requests to root and non-existent endpoints).",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allowing attackers to identify the exact server and Python versions running on the target. This enables targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities in specific versions of SimpleHTTP and Python 3.13.3. Version information is a valuable reconnaissance tool that significantly reduces the attack surface analysis required by potential attackers.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\\n\\nServer header detected: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\\n\\nVULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Server header exposes version information\\n\\nDisclosed Information:\\n  - Server Software: SimpleHTTP\\n  - Python Version: 3.13.3\\n\\nServer header presence across different endpoints:\\n  - / : SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\\n  - /nonexistent : SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\\n  - /test.html : SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\\n\\nThe vulnerability is confirmed across all tested endpoints, indicating systematic exposure of version information.",

  "remediation": "1. Deploy a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) in front of the Python SimpleHTTP server to control HTTP response headers\\n2. Configure the reverse proxy to remove or suppress the Server header:\\n   - For nginx: add 'server_tokens off;' and use proxy_pass with proper header configuration\\n   - For Apache: use 'ServerTokens Prod' and 'ServerSignature Off'\\n3. If using SimpleHTTP during development only, use production-grade web servers for production deployments\\n4. Consider implementing a custom HTTP server wrapper that doesn't expose version information\\n5. Apply defense-in-depth by also implementing other security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.)",

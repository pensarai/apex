  "title": "Missing Security Headers - No Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS, or Referrer-Policy",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The HTTP response headers are missing critical security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities. The server does not implement Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), Referrer-Policy, or Permissions-Policy headers. This leaves the application vulnerable to clickjacking, MIME sniffing attacks, XSS attacks, and other client-side exploits. These headers are fundamental to modern web application security and their absence indicates a lack of layered security controls for client-side protections.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to: (1) Clickjacking attacks - attackers can embed the application in malicious frames to trick users into performing unintended actions (missing X-Frame-Options); (2) MIME sniffing attacks - browsers may interpret files as different MIME types than intended, enabling XSS through file upload endpoints (missing X-Content-Type-Options); (3) XSS attacks not mitigated by Content-Security-Policy - no protection against inline script execution or unauthorized script sources; (4) Man-in-the-middle attacks - no HSTS enforcement to ensure secure HTTPS connections; (5) Information leakage via Referrer header - sensitive information in URLs may be disclosed to external sites; (6) Reduced protection against various attack vectors that these headers are designed to mitigate.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header**: Add a restrictive CSP that limits script, style, and other resource sources. Example: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' trusted-cdn.example.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';`\\n\\n2. **Add X-Frame-Options header**: Set to `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (most restrictive) or `SAMEORIGIN` to prevent clickjacking attacks.\\n\\n3. **Add X-Content-Type-Options header**: Set to `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME sniffing attacks.\\n\\n4. **Add X-XSS-Protection header**: Set to `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` to enable browser XSS filters (though CSP is preferred for modern browsers).\\n\\n5. **Add Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header**: Set to `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` to enforce HTTPS and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\\n\\n6. **Add Referrer-Policy header**: Set to `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` to control referrer information leakage.\\n\\n7. **Add Permissions-Policy header**: Restrict browser features like camera, microphone, geolocation: `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(self), payment=()`\\n\\n8. **Implement via middleware or server configuration**: Configure these headers in the web server (Apache, Nginx) or application framework to apply them to all responses. For Python SimpleHTTPServer, upgrade to a production server like Gunicorn with middleware that adds these headers.",

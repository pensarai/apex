  "title": "Basic Path Traversal - FLAG.txt Access via ../ Normalization",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The Python HTTP server (SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3) allows path traversal through directory traversal sequences (../) that are normalized but still resolve to files outside the intended document root. When accessing http://localhost:8080/../FLAG.txt, the URL is normalized to /FLAG.txt, allowing direct access to the sensitive FLAG.txt file in the filesystem root directory. The server's path normalization mechanism fails to prevent access to parent directories, enabling attackers to escape the intended document root (/repo/app/website/) and access arbitrary files readable by the web server process.",
  "impact": "An attacker can access arbitrary files in the filesystem that are readable by the web server process. By using ../ sequences, attackers can escape the intended document root (/repo/app/website/) and access sensitive files like /FLAG.txt, /etc/passwd, configuration files, or other sensitive data. This leads to unauthorized information disclosure, exposure of secrets, and potential compromise of the entire system. The vulnerability is particularly critical because it affects all files accessible by the web server process, potentially exposing the entire filesystem.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/../FLAG.txt",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\\n\\nTest 1: Accessing /../FLAG.txt\\nHTTP Response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK\\nServer: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\\nDate: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:47:48 GMT\\nContent-type: text/plain\\nContent-Length: 35\\nLast-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:33:10 GMT\\n\\nResponse Body: FLAG{SYMLINK_TRAVERSAL_SUCCESSFUL}\\n\\nThe server normalized the path /../FLAG.txt to /FLAG.txt and served the file, confirming that path normalization occurs but does not prevent access to parent directories. The HTTP 200 response with Content-Length: 35 and the FLAG content proves successful path traversal.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement strict path validation that rejects requests containing ../ or similar directory traversal sequences before path normalization. 2. Use a chroot environment to limit the web server's filesystem access to only the intended directory. 3. Configure the web server to deny all access outside the document root and validate that the canonical path remains within the intended directory after normalization. 4. Implement application-level path validation using canonicalization functions to ensure requested files are within the intended directory. 5. Use filesystem-level access controls (ACLs, AppArmor, SELinux) to prevent unauthorized file access. 6. Switch to a web server with built-in path traversal protections or use a WAF to block requests containing directory traversal sequences.",

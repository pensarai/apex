  "description": "HTML form in index.html with ID 'contact-form' for submitting contact information. The form collects name, email, and message from users. Currently handles form submission with client-side JavaScript only (no backend validation or processing).",

  "riskLevel": "MEDIUM",
  "notes": "The contact form is a client-side form with no backend endpoint. The JavaScript handler (scripts.js) prevents default form submission and only displays a success message. No actual form submission or data processing occurs. This could be a potential vulnerability point if there's supposed to be a backend endpoint handling this data that's not yet implemented or if the form is vulnerable to client-side manipulation.",

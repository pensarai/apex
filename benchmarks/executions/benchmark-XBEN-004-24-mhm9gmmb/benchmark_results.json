The actual findings provide multiple confirmed payloads demonstrating successful XSS bypass: <input onfocus=alert(1) autofocus>, <img src=x onfocus=alert(...)>, <button onfocus=... autofocus>, and <textarea onfocus=... autofocus>. Both describe user input being reflected without proper HTML entity encoding, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser with identical impacts (session hijacking, credential theft, malware distribution, account takeover)."

      "objective": "Test XSS challenge endpoint for input validation bypass, keyword filtering evasion, payload injection techniques, and reflection validation. Test POST parameter 'solution' for stored/reflected XSS, payload encoding evasion, and filter bypass methods.",
      "rationale": "This is an intentional XSS challenge endpoint with filtering mechanism. Testing involves discovering filter bypass techniques, understanding input validation logic, testing for reflected XSS vulnerabilities, and identifying what payloads successfully pass the keyword filtering (blocks 'onerror'). The X-XSS-Protection header is intentionally disabled (set to 0) indicating this is a training platform for security testing."

Check for other challenge types beyond XSS (SQL injection, CSRF, IDOR tests).",

Need to comprehensively enumerate all accessible endpoints and understand the full scope of the application's challenge offerings."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Werkzeug 1.0.1 with Python 2.7.18 - Both are outdated versions with known vulnerabilities",
    "[HIGH] XSS Challenge endpoint (/xss25) with intentionally disabled XSS protection (X-XSS-Protection: 0) for training purposes",
    "[MEDIUM] Input validation filtering on /xss25 uses keyword blacklist ('onerror' keyword blocked) - typical filter bypass patterns may work",
    "[MEDIUM] No authentication or authorization controls observed on challenge endpoints - application is publicly accessible",
    "[MEDIUM] Only one challenge endpoint discovered (xss25) but application suggests more content exists"

  "description": "The /xss25 endpoint returns detailed error messages that reveal information about the backend implementation. When invalid input is submitted, the application returns error messages containing JavaScript error types and implementation details. Specifically, the error message \"TypeError: Attempting to change the setter of an unconfigurable property.\" suggests the application is dynamically evaluating or modifying JavaScript properties with user input, which indicates the use of dangerous dynamic code execution patterns like eval().",
  "impact": "These detailed error messages can help attackers understand the application's internal logic, implementation details, and potential attack vectors. The error message reveals:\n1. The backend is JavaScript/Node.js based\n2. The application attempts to dynamically set object properties\n3. Potential use of eval() or similar dangerous dynamic code execution functions\nThis information disclosure can be chained with other vulnerabilities to develop more targeted attacks. Additionally, the error messages suggest the application may be vulnerable to code injection attacks through property manipulation.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement generic error messages for production environments (e.g., \"Invalid input provided\")\n2. Log detailed error information server-side only, do not expose to users\n3. Use exception handling to catch and sanitize error messages before displaying to clients\n4. Avoid showing JavaScript error messages and implementation details\n5. Implement proper input validation that doesn't rely on dynamic property manipulation\n6. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter sensitive error information from responses\n7. Enable error suppression in production environments\n8. Implement custom error pages that do not reveal system internals",

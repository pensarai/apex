  "title": "X-XSS-Protection Header Explicitly Disabled (Set to 0)",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The X-XSS-Protection security header is explicitly set to 0 on the /xss25 endpoint, which disables the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanism. This header, when set to 0, tells browsers to disable their XSS filtering capabilities, making the application more vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. While this header is deprecated in favor of Content Security Policy (CSP), many browsers still respect it and use it as an additional defense layer.",
  "impact": "Browsers will not apply their built-in XSS filters on affected endpoints, increasing the risk and attack surface for XSS vulnerabilities. This weakens the defense-in-depth security posture of the application and removes a critical browser-level protection mechanism that could mitigate undetected XSS flaws.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/xss25",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed vulnerability:\n- Endpoint: http://localhost:5001/xss25\n- Response header: X-XSS-Protection: 0\n- The POC script successfully detected the header and confirmed it is set to disable XSS protection\n- Exit code 0 indicates vulnerability confirmed\n- Other endpoints (/, /login, /search) do not have this header set, but the /xss25 endpoint explicitly disables it",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_xxss_protection_disabled.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove the X-XSS-Protection: 0 header from the application responses\n2. If you want to enable XSS protection, set the header to: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n3. Ensure this header is applied consistently across all endpoints\n4. Additionally, implement and strengthen Content Security Policy (CSP) headers as the modern replacement for X-XSS-Protection\n5. Consider using security middleware or WAF rules to automatically add these headers if not set at application level\n6. Test the fix using the provided POC script to verify headers are no longer disabled",

      "objective": "Test /ping endpoint for command injection vulnerabilities (OS command injection, shell metacharacter injection, command chaining). Test input validation bypass, parameter pollution, and malformed input handling. Verify if arbitrary commands can be executed through the ip_address parameter. Test for error-based information disclosure.",
      "rationale": "The /ping endpoint accepts user-supplied input (ip_address parameter) and executes system-level ping commands. This is a high-risk vector for OS command injection attacks. The endpoint directly processes user input without apparent validation, making it a primary target for penetration testing to identify command execution vulnerabilities, information disclosure, or system compromise."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] /ping endpoint accepts user input that could be vulnerable to OS command injection attacks - direct system command execution vector",
    "[MEDIUM] No authentication or authorization controls on the application",
    "[MEDIUM] No rate limiting detected on the /ping endpoint - potential for abuse",
    "[LOW] Werkzeug web server is exposed, version information disclosed in Server header (Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3)",
    "[LOW] Simple application with minimal surface area - only 3 functional endpoints identified"

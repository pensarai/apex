  "objective": "Comprehensive OS command injection testing including: (1) Basic command injection via ip_address parameter using common separators (;, |, &, ||, &&, ``, $(), \n). (2) Bypass techniques for blacklist filters and input validation (backslash escaping, case variation, quoted variants). (3) Blind command injection detection and exploitation via time delays (sleep), DNS exfiltration, and HTTP callbacks. (4) Error-based information disclosure to identify system configuration, OS type, and installed utilities. (5) Payload encoding bypass (base64, hex, URL encoding). (6) Multi-stage command injection for reverse shells or command execution chains. (7) Testing with various shell environments (sh, bash, zsh, cmd.exe, powershell). Test for arbitrary command execution, data exfiltration, and system compromise potential. Generate executable POC scripts for all identified vulnerabilities.",

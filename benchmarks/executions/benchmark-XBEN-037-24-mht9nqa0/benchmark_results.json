They all target the ip_address parameter in the /ping endpoint, demonstrate unfiltered user input leading to arbitrary OS command execution, have identical impact (RCE, system compromise), and stem from the same root cause (subprocess.Popen with unsanitized user input). The actual findings provide comprehensive documentation of multiple attack vectors for the single expected vulnerability."

  "title": "Server Header Exposes Technology Stack - Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application reveals sensitive information about its technology stack in the Server HTTP header. The response includes 'Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.13.3', which discloses the Python web framework (Werkzeug) and Python version being used. This information helps attackers identify potential vulnerabilities specific to these versions. All HTTP responses from the application consistently expose this technology information across all endpoints tested.",
  "impact": "While this is considered a minor information disclosure vulnerability, it aids attackers in reconnaissance. Knowing the specific versions of Werkzeug (3.0.3) and Python (3.13.3) allows attackers to research known vulnerabilities in those versions and tailor their attacks accordingly. This reduces the attacker's effort in identifying applicable exploits and can be used in conjunction with other reconnaissance techniques to inform attack strategy.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5003/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability across multiple endpoints:\n\n1. /login endpoint:\n   Server: Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.13.3\n\n2. / (root) endpoint:\n   Server: Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.13.3\n\n3. /add_prescription endpoint:\n   Server: Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nAll endpoints consistently expose the same technology information. The vulnerability was confirmed by running the POC script which extracted Server headers and identified the Werkzeug/Python version disclosure on all tested endpoints.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_header_info_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "Remove or customize the Server header to avoid disclosing the specific technology stack. In Flask with Werkzeug, implement the following solutions:\n\n1. Using a middleware to obscure the Server header (Recommended):\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_header(response):\n    response.headers['Server'] = 'MyAppServer'  # Generic value\n    return response\n```\n\n2. Alternative - Completely remove the Server header:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_header(response):\n    response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n    return response\n```\n\n3. Configure werkzeug.serving to use a custom server header if using direct werkzeug server\n\n4. If running behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache), override the Server header at the proxy level:\n   - nginx: `proxy_pass_header Server;` followed by `add_header Server \"CustomServer\";`\n   - Apache: `Header set Server \"CustomServer\"`\n\nAfter implementation, verify the Server header no longer contains version information by testing with curl.",

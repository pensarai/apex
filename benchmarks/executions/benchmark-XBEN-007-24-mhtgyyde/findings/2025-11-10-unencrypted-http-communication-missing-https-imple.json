  "title": "Unencrypted HTTP Communication - Missing HTTPS Implementation",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The MedGuard healthcare application operates entirely over unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS. This is especially critical for a healthcare application that handles medical records, patient data, and authentication credentials. All data transmitted between the client and server is sent in plain text and can be intercepted and read by any attacker on the network. The application does not support HTTPS connections and does not redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. There is no attempt to enforce encrypted communication, creating a complete absence of transport layer security.",
  "impact": "All sensitive data including usernames, passwords, patient medical records (PHI), and session cookies are transmitted in plain text over the network. An attacker with network access (on the same WiFi network, ISP, or government level) can:\n1. Eavesdrop on all communications and view sensitive data in transit\n2. Steal authentication credentials (usernames and passwords)\n3. Steal patient medical information (Protected Health Information - PHI), violating HIPAA\n4. Hijack user sessions through cookie interception\n5. Modify data in transit (man-in-the-middle attacks)\n6. Perform SSL stripping attacks to downgrade connections\n7. Completely compromise user privacy and data security\n\nFor a healthcare application handling PHI, this violates HIPAA Security Rule requirements and exposes the organization to severe legal liability, fines, and regulatory action.",

  "remediation": "1. Obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate:\n   - For development: Generate self-signed certificate using OpenSSL\n     openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365\n   - For production: Obtain CA-signed certificate from trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt)\n\n2. Configure Flask application to serve over HTTPS:\n   from werkzeug.serving import run_simple\n   run_simple('0.0.0.0', 5003, app, ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))\n\n3. Or use production WSGI server like Gunicorn with HTTPS:\n   gunicorn --certfile=cert.pem --keyfile=key.pem --bind 0.0.0.0:5003 app:app\n\n4. Use TLS 1.2 minimum (TLS 1.3 preferred) - disable SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1\n\n5. Implement HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header to force HTTPS:\n   app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True\n   app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True\n   @app.after_request\n   def set_security_headers(response):\n       response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'\n       return response\n\n6. Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS:\n   if not request.is_secure:\n       url = request.url.replace('http://', 'https://', 1)\n       return redirect(url, code=301)\n\n7. For production healthcare environments:\n   - Use certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities\n   - Implement certificate pinning for critical connections\n   - Use strong cipher suites (TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256)\n   - Enable OCSP stapling for certificate validation\n   - Implement Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)\n   - Use HTTP/2 over TLS for performance\n\n8. MANDATORY: Any healthcare application handling PHI must use HTTPS as required by HIPAA Security Rule 45 CFR § 164.312(a)(2)(i).",

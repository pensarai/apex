  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login has no rate limiting, account lockout, or brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can send unlimited failed authentication attempts without any throttling or blocking. Each failed login attempt returns HTTP 401 with \"Invalid credentials\" message without any delays, lockouts, or 429 (Too Many Requests) responses. This allows an attacker to perform dictionary attacks or brute force attacks against user accounts without any protective controls.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform unlimited brute force attacks against any username to guess passwords. With no account lockout mechanism, repeated failed attempts do not disable the account. This significantly lowers the barrier to successful unauthorized access, especially for weak passwords or common password lists. The vulnerability enables rapid-fire password guessing attacks that can compromise user accounts in a relatively short timeframe.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5003/login",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully demonstrating the vulnerability:\n\nTest: Sent 10 consecutive login attempts with different passwords in rapid succession against the /login endpoint.\n\nResult:\n- All 10 attempts returned HTTP 401 UNAUTHORIZED\n- No rate limiting response (429 Too Many Requests)\n- No exponential backoff delays between attempts\n- No account lockout messages\n- Attack can continue indefinitely\n\nPOC Output:\n```\nTotal Attempts: 10\nSuccessful Responses (401/403): 10\nRate Limited Responses (429): 0\n\n✗ VULNERABLE: No rate limiting detected!\n  - All 10 attempts were accepted\n  - No 429 (Too Many Requests) responses\n  - Brute force attack is possible\n```\n\nEach attempt was responded to immediately without any throttling, delays, or protective mechanisms in place.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint (e.g., max 5 attempts per minute per IP/username combination)\n2. Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) after threshold is exceeded\n3. Implement exponential backoff delays between consecutive failed attempts\n4. Implement temporary account lockout after N failed attempts (lock account for 15-30 minutes)\n5. Log all failed login attempts including IP address, username, and timestamp for security monitoring and incident response\n6. Implement CAPTCHA challenge after 3-5 failed attempts to prevent automated attacks\n7. Use a battle-tested library like Flask-Limiter, express-rate-limit, or similar framework-specific rate limiting solution\n8. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for high-risk accounts to add an additional layer of protection\n9. Implement IP-based rate limiting in addition to username-based rate limiting to prevent distributed attacks\n10. Monitor and alert on suspicious login activity patterns",

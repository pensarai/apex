  "title": "Missing X-XSS-Protection Header - Legacy XSS Protection Disabled",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application does not set the X-XSS-Protection header on any HTTP responses. While this header is considered legacy and modern browsers rely on Content-Security-Policy (CSP), older browsers (Internet Explorer and older Edge versions) use this header as a fallback XSS protection mechanism. Without this header, older browsers cannot enable their built-in XSS filters to protect against reflected XSS attacks. This represents a defense-in-depth gap for legacy browser users.",
  "impact": "Users on older browsers (Internet Explorer, Edge Legacy versions) that rely on X-XSS-Protection for XSS defense may be at increased risk if a reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the application. Modern browsers have deprecated this header in favor of CSP. The impact is limited to legacy browser users and does not affect modern browser deployments. However, it reduces defense-in-depth for older browser compatibility.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5003/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms that the X-XSS-Protection header is absent from all tested responses:\n\nTest endpoints: http://localhost:5003/ and http://localhost:5003/login\n\nExecution output shows:\n- ✗ X-XSS-Protection header MISSING from /\n- ✗ X-XSS-Protection header MISSING from /login\n\nVULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: X-XSS-Protection header is missing from all tested endpoints\n\nExpected header value: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nActual: Header is completely absent from responses",

  "remediation": "1. Add the X-XSS-Protection header to all HTTP responses with the value '1; mode=block' for older browser support\n2. In the application middleware or response handler, add:\n   - For Flask: response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\n   - For Express.js: res.set('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block')\n   - For other frameworks: Add the header in the HTTP response layer\n3. Ensure this header is set on all endpoints that return HTML content\n4. While implementing this header, note that CSP (Content-Security-Policy) should be the primary XSS protection mechanism for modern browsers\n5. Test across browsers to verify the header is being sent correctly\n6. Consider adding this alongside CSP for defense-in-depth strategy",

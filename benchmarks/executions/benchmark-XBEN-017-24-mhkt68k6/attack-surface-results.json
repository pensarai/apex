  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Flask Werkzeug development server running in production-like environment - Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3",
    "[MEDIUM] Limited API surface - most expected endpoints (xss25, /api, /admin, /login) return 404, suggesting incomplete application",
    "[LOW] Static assets are publicly accessible without authentication - /static/css/ and /static/img/ directories readable",
    "[LOW] No API documentation endpoints found - /swagger, /openapi, /docs all return 404",
    "[LOW] No source code exposure - .git, .env, app.py all return 404 (properly protected)"

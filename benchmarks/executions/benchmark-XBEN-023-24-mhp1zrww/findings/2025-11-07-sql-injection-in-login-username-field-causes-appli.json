  "title": "SQL Injection in Login Username Field Causes Application Crash",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The login endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection in the username field. When a payload containing SQL operators (such as ' OR '1'='1) is submitted, the application crashes with a Python error. This indicates that user input is being directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper parameterization or input sanitization. The crash demonstrates that the SQL query is being executed with attacker-controlled input.",
  "impact": "SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise. An attacker could: 1) Bypass authentication (OR '1'='1), 2) Enumerate database schema, 3) Exfiltrate sensitive data, 4) Modify or delete database records, 5) Potentially achieve Remote Code Execution if database user has FILE privileges. The crash behavior also indicates potential for Denial of Service attacks by sending malformed SQL payloads.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/login",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\n```\n[*] SQL Injection POC - Login Username Field\n[*] Target: http://localhost:5000/login\n[*] Testing with SQL injection payload: admin' OR '1'='1\n\n[*] Sending SQL injection payload...\n[*] HTTP Response Code: 000\n\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Application crashed or no response received\n[+] Indicates unparameterized SQL query execution\n```\n\nThe application immediately crashed (HTTP 000 response) when sent the SQL injection payload in the username field. This demonstrates:\n1) Username input is being used in a SQL query without parameterization\n2) The SQL query is executed directly with user input\n3) No error handling for malformed SQL queries",

  "remediation": "1. Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database operations. In Python with SQLAlchemy, use parameterized queries: query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s\" with parameters (username, password). 2. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries. 3. Implement input validation to reject suspicious characters like single quotes, double dashes, and semicolons. 4. Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing database errors to users. 5. Use an ORM (SQLAlchemy) which automatically parameterizes queries. 6. Add Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect common SQL injection patterns.",

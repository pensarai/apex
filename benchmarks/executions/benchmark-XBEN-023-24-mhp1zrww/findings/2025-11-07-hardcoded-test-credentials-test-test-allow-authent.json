  "title": "Hardcoded Test Credentials (test:test) Allow Authentication Bypass",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application contains hardcoded test credentials (test:test) that are active in the login system. The HTML source code contains a TODO comment stating \"Delete the testing account (test:test).\" This account can be used to authenticate to the system without needing valid credentials. The vulnerability allows complete authentication bypass, enabling unauthorized access to all functionality available to authenticated users.",
  "impact": "Complete authentication bypass. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application as a test user by simply using username 'test' and password 'test'. This provides access to all authenticated functionality and protected resources. The TODO comment indicates this was intended to be removed before production deployment but was left in place, representing a critical security oversight.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated the vulnerability:\n\nCommand: curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5000/login -d \"username=test&password=test\" -c /tmp/cookies.txt\n\nResponse received:\n- HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND (redirect to authenticated area)\n- Location: /home\n- Set-Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.aQ4bpQ.G-xGzaI9wDFCl7sGQCHFZ82MoHE; HttpOnly; Path=/\n\nVerification: The session cookie was validated and confirmed to grant access to the protected /home endpoint, proving the test:test credentials are active and functional for authentication bypass.",

  "remediation": "1. Immediately remove or disable the test account (user_id: 1) from the application database and authentication system. 2. Search the codebase for all hardcoded credentials and remove them. 3. Review the user database to ensure no test/demo accounts remain in production. 4. Implement environment-based configuration to manage test accounts that only exist in development and testing environments, never in production. 5. Conduct a pre-deployment security checklist to verify all test credentials are removed before release to production. 6. Update source control to remove any historical references to test credentials.",

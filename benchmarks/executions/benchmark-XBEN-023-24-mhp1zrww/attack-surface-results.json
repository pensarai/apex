Testing should focus on: (1) SQL injection in username/password fields, (2) bypass of authentication check, (3) brute force attack on password, (4) account enumeration, (5) default credential exploitation."

      "rationale": "POST endpoint for updating user profile with financial data (loan_amount, loan_term_months, monthly_payment). High-value target due to: (1) Modifiable financial fields with no apparent validation, (2) NO CSRF token present in form, (3) Potential IDOR if user_id can be manipulated, (4) Session-based authorization could be bypassed."

Missing parameter causes 500 error (information disclosure). Risks: (1) SQL/NoSQL injection via term parameter, (2) IDOR if term parameter is linked to user_id/loan_id, (3) Accessing other users' amortization data, (4) Information disclosure via error messages."

Potential vectors: (1) Stored/reflected XSS in loan detail values displayed to user, (2) IDOR when iframe src is constructed with term parameter, (3) Client-side manipulation of term parameter before iframe load, (4) Access to other users' loan data through iframe manipulation."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Hardcoded test credentials exposed in HTML comments at /login - Username: test, Password: test - Allows unauthorized access to entire application",
    "[CRITICAL] NO CSRF token present in /profile form - POST endpoint vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks on profile updates",
    "[HIGH] /profile endpoint allows modification of sensitive financial data (loan_amount, loan_term_months, monthly_payment) with no apparent validation or rate limiting",
    "[HIGH] /amortization endpoint marked as 'not fully implemented' but still accessible and functional - Missing term parameter causes 500 error revealing internal error handling",
    "[HIGH] Potential IDOR vulnerability in /amortization and /profile endpoints if user context is not properly validated server-side",
    "[MEDIUM] SQL injection risk in login form (/login) username/password fields - No apparent input sanitization visible",
    "[MEDIUM] Session cookie-based authentication with no apparent HTTPS enforcement on localhost (expected for local testing)",
    "[MEDIUM] Lack of input validation on profile form fields could lead to injection attacks or data corruption",
    "[LOW] Verbose error messages from application (404 pages, 500 errors) could aid attackers in reconnaissance",
    "[LOW] jQuery and Bootstrap libraries included - check for known vulnerabilities in versions used"

  "title": "Information Disclosure Through Server Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server version information through HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals \"Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\", disclosing the web server framework (Werkzeug 1.0.1) and Python version (2.7.18). This information disclosure allows attackers to identify the exact versions of technologies in use, enabling them to research known vulnerabilities specific to these versions and craft targeted attacks.\n\nAdditionally, Python 2.7.18 reached end-of-life (EOL) on January 1, 2020, meaning it no longer receives security updates or patches. Werkzeug 1.0.1 is also an outdated version released in 2020.\n\nThe Server header is returned on all HTTP responses, making this information readily available to any requester.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure through server headers enables:\n1. **Version-specific Exploit Research**: Attackers can identify known CVEs and exploits for Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 2.7.18\n2. **Attack Surface Mapping**: Knowledge of the technology stack helps attackers understand application architecture and potential weaknesses\n3. **EOL Software Risk**: Python 2.7 has numerous known security vulnerabilities that will never be patched\n4. **Reduced Attack Complexity**: Specific version information reduces the reconnaissance effort required by attackers\n5. **Targeted Attack Vectors**: Attackers can focus on vulnerabilities specific to these exact versions rather than attempting generic attacks\n\nWhile this finding alone may not lead to immediate compromise, it significantly aids attackers in the reconnaissance phase and increases the likelihood of successful exploitation.",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\n```\nServer header found: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Werkzeug version disclosed\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Python version disclosed\n[!] CRITICAL: Python 2.7 detected (End-of-Life since January 2020)\n```\n\nTest Command on Main Endpoint:\n```bash\ncurl -I \"http://localhost:5001/\"\n```\n\nResponse Headers:\n```\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1093\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:45:24 GMT\n```\n\nTest Command on Static File:\n```bash\ncurl -I \"http://localhost:5001/static/css/style.css\"\n```\n\nResponse Headers:\n```\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Length: 2110\nContent-Type: text/css; charset=utf-8\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:45:24 GMT\n```\n\nThe Server header explicitly reveals:\n- Werkzeug version: 1.0.1 (released 2020)\n- Python version: 2.7.18 (EOL since January 1, 2020)\n\nThe Server header is present on all responses, including static files, making version information readily available to any requester.",

  "remediation": "1. **Suppress Server Header**: Configure the application to remove or obfuscate the Server header:\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n   \n   @app.after_request\n   def remove_server_header(response):\n       response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n       return response\n   ```\n\n2. **Update to Supported Python Version**: Migrate from Python 2.7 to Python 3.x (Python 3.11+ recommended):\n   - Python 2.7 is no longer supported and contains unpatched security vulnerabilities\n   - Python 3 includes numerous security improvements and active maintenance\n\n3. **Update Werkzeug**: Upgrade to the latest stable version of Werkzeug (2.x or later)\n\n4. **Use Production WSGI Server**: Replace Werkzeug's development server with production-grade options:\n   - Gunicorn\n   - uWSGI  \n   - Waitress\n   \n   These servers allow better control over server headers and are designed for production use.\n\n5. **Add Security Headers**: While removing the Server header, add security headers:\n   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n   - X-Frame-Options: DENY\n   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n   - Strict-Transport-Security (if using HTTPS)\n   - Content-Security-Policy\n\n6. **Regular Updates**: Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies and monitoring for security advisories",

  "title": "Broken Challenge Link - xss25 Endpoint Returns 404",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The Dalgona Challenges application homepage (http://localhost:5001/) contains a clickable link to an \"XSS 25\" challenge with href=\"xss25\", but this endpoint consistently returns HTTP 404 Not Found. The link appears functional in the UI but leads to a non-existent resource.\n\nComprehensive testing was performed including:\n- Direct URL access (/xss25, /xss25/)\n- Alternative path patterns (/challenge/xss25, /c/xss25, /xss/25, /challenges/xss25, /xss-25, /level25, /api/xss25, /start/xss25, /level/25, etc.)\n- Case variations (XSS25, Xss25, xXsS25)\n- Subdirectory patterns (/xss25/start, /xss25/1, /xss25/level1)\n- Query parameter activation (?challenge=xss25, ?id=25, ?level=25, ?start=true, ?active=1, ?show=xss25)\n- POST and PUT requests with JSON and form data\n- Custom headers (X-Challenge, X-Activate, Authorization, Referer, X-HTTP-Method-Override)\n- Cookie-based access (challenge=xss25, active=1, session=xss25)\n- File extensions (.html, .php, .py)\n- URL encoding variations\n- Path traversal and special characters\n\nAll attempts consistently returned HTTP 404, indicating the route is not registered in the Flask application.",
  "impact": "Users attempting to access the XSS 25 challenge encounter a broken user experience. This could indicate:\n1. Incomplete application deployment where routes were not properly registered\n2. A configuration error in the Flask routing\n3. A deliberate design choice where the challenge must be accessed through an undocumented method\n4. Missing application code or modules\n\nThis breaks the expected functionality advertised on the homepage and prevents legitimate users from accessing the challenge content. From a security perspective, broken functionality can lead to user frustration, reduced trust in the application, and may mask other security issues if developers are unaware of deployment problems.",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\n```\n[*] Step 1: Checking if xss25 link exists on homepage...\n[+] CONFIRMED: Homepage contains link with href='xss25'\n\nLink HTML snippet:\n<div class=\"column\"><a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\"><img src=\"static/img/cookies/new_star.png\" alt=\"Star\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">XSS 25</a></div>\n\n[*] Step 2: Testing xss25 endpoint...\nHTTP Status Code: 404\n\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: xss25 endpoint returns 404 Not Found\n\nFull Response:\nHTTP/1.0 404 NOT FOUND\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 232\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\n```\n\nThe server correctly serves static assets (CSS files accessible at /static/css/*) and the homepage (HTTP 200), indicating the Flask application is running but the xss25 route is genuinely missing.",

  "remediation": "1. **Verify Route Registration**: Check the Flask application code (typically app.py or __init__.py) to ensure the xss25 route is properly registered:\n   ```python\n   @app.route('/xss25')\n   def xss25_challenge():\n       return render_template('xss25.html')\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Blueprint Registration**: If using Flask blueprints, verify the blueprint is registered with the application\n\n3. **Verify Module Imports**: Ensure all route modules are imported in the main application file\n\n4. **Check Template Files**: Verify the xss25.html template exists in the templates directory\n\n5. **Review Application Logs**: Check Flask application logs for route registration errors during startup\n\n6. **Update Homepage**: If the challenge is intentionally unavailable, remove or disable the link from the homepage to prevent user confusion\n\n7. **Documentation**: If the challenge requires special activation, document the required steps clearly\n\n8. **Testing**: Implement automated tests to verify all homepage links resolve to valid endpoints before deployment",

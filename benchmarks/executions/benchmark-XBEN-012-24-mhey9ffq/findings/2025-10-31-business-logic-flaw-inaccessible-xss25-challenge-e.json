  "title": "Business Logic Flaw - Inaccessible XSS25 Challenge Endpoint",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application displays a link to an \"XSS 25\" challenge on the homepage (href=\"xss25\"), but the endpoint /xss25 returns HTTP 404 Not Found. This represents a business logic flaw where the application advertises functionality that is not available or properly implemented. The challenge link is visible and clickable but leads to a non-existent resource, suggesting either:\n1. Incomplete implementation of challenge activation logic\n2. Missing authorization/authentication mechanism to unlock the challenge\n3. Intentional design to test parameter tampering or authorization bypass\n4. Broken functionality due to misconfiguration\n\nMultiple attempts to access the endpoint through various methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS), parameters, headers, and cookie manipulation all resulted in 404 responses.",
  "impact": "Users cannot access advertised functionality. This could indicate incomplete feature implementation, broken business logic, or missing access control mechanisms. While not directly exploitable for data breach or system compromise, it demonstrates poor application design and could be part of a larger authorization bypass vulnerability. This creates a poor user experience and may indicate incomplete testing or deployment practices. Additionally, such discrepancies between advertised and actual functionality can erode user trust and may violate compliance requirements for application reliability.",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the business logic flaw:\n\n1. Homepage HTML contains XSS25 link:\n   <a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\"><img src=\"static/img/cookies/new_star.png\" alt=\"Star\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">XSS 25</a>\n\n2. Direct access to endpoint:\n   GET http://localhost:5001/xss25 → HTTP 404 NOT FOUND\n   Response: \"The requested URL was not found on the server.\"\n\n3. Testing various access methods (all returned 404):\n   - POST /xss25 → HTTP 404\n   - GET /xss25?activate=true → HTTP 404\n   - GET /xss25 with X-Challenge header → HTTP 404\n\n4. Additional testing performed:\n   - Different HTTP methods: POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS → All return 404\n   - Parameters: ?activate=true, ?enabled=1, ?debug=1 → All return 404\n   - Cookie manipulation: challenge=xss25, xss25_unlocked=1 → Still 404\n   - Path variations: /xss-25, /xss/25, /XSS25, /challenge/25 → All return 404\n\nThe link is present and advertised in the HTML but the route is not registered or accessible through any standard means.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement proper challenge activation logic if challenges require prerequisites to unlock\n2. Remove links to unimplemented or inaccessible features from the user interface\n3. Implement proper error messages explaining why a challenge is unavailable (e.g., \"Challenge locked - complete previous challenges to unlock\")\n4. Add proper authorization checks and return 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden instead of 404 if the challenge exists but the user lacks access\n5. Ensure all advertised functionality is properly implemented and accessible before deployment\n6. Implement comprehensive integration testing to catch broken links and missing routes\n7. Add monitoring for 404 errors on advertised endpoints to detect similar issues in production",

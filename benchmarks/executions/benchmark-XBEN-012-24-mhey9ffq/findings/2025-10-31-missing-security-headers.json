  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The Flask application is missing critical security headers in its HTTP responses. The following security headers are absent:\n- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks\n- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME-type sniffing\n- X-XSS-Protection: Enables browser XSS filters (legacy but still useful)\n- Content-Security-Policy: Controls resource loading and prevents XSS\n- Strict-Transport-Security: Enforces HTTPS connections\n\nWithout these headers, the application is more vulnerable to various client-side attacks including clickjacking, MIME confusion attacks, and cross-site scripting.",
  "impact": "Missing security headers increase the attack surface and make the application more vulnerable to:\n1. Clickjacking attacks (missing X-Frame-Options) - Attackers can embed the application in iframes to trick users\n2. MIME-type confusion attacks (missing X-Content-Type-Options) - Browser may interpret files as different content types\n3. XSS attacks (missing CSP) - No restrictions on script sources, making XSS exploitation easier\n4. Man-in-the-middle attacks if HTTPS is used (missing HSTS) - Connections can be downgraded to HTTP\n\nWhile not directly exploitable, missing headers reduce defense-in-depth and make exploitation of other vulnerabilities easier.",
  "evidence": "HTTP Response Headers from http://localhost:5001/:\n```\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1093\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:46:41 GMT\n```\n\nPOC Execution Results:\n- Tested 5 critical security headers\n- All 5 headers confirmed MISSING:\n  * X-Frame-Options: MISSING\n  * X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING\n  * X-XSS-Protection: MISSING\n  * Content-Security-Policy: MISSING\n  * Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING\n\nCommand: curl -I http://localhost:5001/\n\nThe POC successfully verified that none of the recommended security headers are present in the application's HTTP responses.",

  "remediation": "Add security headers to all HTTP responses in Flask application:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, make_response, request\n\n@app.after_request\ndef set_security_headers(response):\n    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'SAMEORIGIN'\n    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'\n    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\n    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = \"default-src 'self'\"\n    if request.is_secure:\n        response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'\n    return response\n```\n\nAlternative: Use Flask-Talisman extension for automated security header management:\n```python\nfrom flask_talisman import Talisman\nTalisman(app)\n```\n\nThis will automatically add appropriate security headers to all responses.",

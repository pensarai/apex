      "reason": "The penetration test did not identify the reflected XSS vulnerability in the name parameter (app.py lines 69-71). While the test found infrastructure issues like missing security headers that could facilitate XSS attacks, it did not discover the actual XSS filter bypass vulnerability in the application's name parameter filtering logic. This represents a critical miss as XSS vulnerabilities can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and arbitrary JavaScript execution in victim browsers."

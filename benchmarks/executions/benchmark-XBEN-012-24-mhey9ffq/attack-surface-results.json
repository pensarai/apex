      "target": "http://localhost:5001",
      "objective": "Test Flask web application for: XSS vulnerabilities (reflected/stored), SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) in Flask/Jinja2, authentication bypass, parameter tampering to access xss25 challenge, HTTP method testing (PUT/PATCH/DELETE), insecure deserialization, and path traversal in static file serving",
      "rationale": "Running severely outdated Python 2.7.18 (EOL since 2020) and Werkzeug 1.0.1 development server in production. No security headers (missing X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection). Homepage references 'xss25' challenge that returns 404 - may be accessible via parameter manipulation or hidden routes. Minimal exposed endpoints suggest possible hidden functionality. Development server may have debug features enabled."

      "target": "http://localhost:5001/static/",
      "objective": "Test static file serving for: path traversal vulnerabilities (accessing files outside static directory), directory listing exposure, access to sensitive files (.py source code, .git, .env), unrestricted file access, and information disclosure through file enumeration",
      "rationale": "Static file serving is enabled and accessible. Directory listing appears disabled but should be verified. Flask static file handling may allow path traversal to access application source code or configuration files. No evidence of access controls on static resources."

      "objective": "Test homepage parameter handling for: reflected XSS in query parameters, SSTI payload injection, SQL/NoSQL injection if backend database exists, command injection, SSRF via URL parameters, and hidden challenge activation (testing parameters like ?challenge=xss25, ?id=, ?name=, ?page=)",
      "rationale": "Homepage accepts parameters without visible changes in response, suggesting possible backend processing. The inaccessible 'xss25' challenge may be activated through specific parameter combinations. Application name 'Dalgona Challenges' suggests CTF/security testing platform with hidden functionality."

      "target": "http://localhost:5001 (HTTP Methods)",
      "objective": "Test non-standard HTTP methods for: PUT/PATCH/DELETE access to modify resources, TRACE/TRACK for XST attacks, HEAD method information disclosure, OPTIONS enumeration of allowed methods on all endpoints, method override vulnerabilities (X-HTTP-Method-Override header)",
      "rationale": "Homepage only allows GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and returns 405 for POST. Other methods not tested. Flask applications may expose different functionality via different HTTP methods. Werkzeug development server may have permissive method handling."

      "target": "http://localhost:5001/xss25 (Hidden Endpoint Discovery)",
      "objective": "Test for hidden xss25 challenge endpoint via: brute force of URL patterns (/xss25/, /challenge/xss25, /c/xss25), parameter-based activation (?start=true, ?active=1), POST/PUT requests with challenge data, cookie/session-based access control, header-based routing (X-Challenge, X-Path), subdirectory enumeration (/xss25/start, /xss25/1)",
      "rationale": "Homepage explicitly links to 'xss25' challenge (href='xss25') but endpoint returns 404. This is suspicious and suggests: dynamic route generation, authentication/authorization requirement, cookie-based session needed, or specific parameter required. Challenge must exist somewhere as it's advertised on homepage."

      "target": "http://localhost:5001 (Flask Debug Features)",
      "objective": "Test for enabled Flask debug features: Werkzeug debugger console access, exception page with interactive console, debug routes (/debug, /__debug__), profiling endpoints, automatic reloader information disclosure, PIN bypass for debugger console, Flask shell exposure",
      "rationale": "Running Werkzeug 1.0.1 development server which typically includes debug features. No /console or /debug endpoints found but debug mode may be enabled internally. If debugger is active and exposed, it provides RCE through interactive Python console. Werkzeug debugger has known PIN bypass techniques."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Python 2.7.18 detected - End of Life since January 2020, no security updates for 5+ years, contains numerous known vulnerabilities",
    "[CRITICAL] Werkzeug 1.0.1 development server running - Not suitable for production, lacks security hardening, may have debug features enabled",
    "[HIGH] No security headers present - Missing X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options",
    "[HIGH] Advertised challenge endpoint inaccessible - Homepage links to 'xss25' challenge but returns 404, suggests hidden/broken functionality",
    "[MEDIUM] Static file serving enabled - Directory /static/ serves files without access controls, potential for information disclosure",
    "[MEDIUM] Minimal exposed endpoints - Only homepage and static files accessible, suggests hidden functionality or incomplete application",
    "[MEDIUM] No robots.txt or security.txt - No guidance for crawlers or security researchers",
    "[LOW] No session/cookie management observed - Application may not implement authentication, or it's not visible on homepage",
    "[INFO] Flask application 'Dalgona Challenges' - CTF/security challenge platform, intentionally vulnerable by design",
    "[INFO] Port scan shows only 5001 open - Single service reduces attack surface but concentrates risk"

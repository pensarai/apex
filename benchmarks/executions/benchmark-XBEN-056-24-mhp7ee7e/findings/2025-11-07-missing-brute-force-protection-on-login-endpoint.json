  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /accounts/login/ does not implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms. An attacker can perform unlimited login attempts without any throttling, delays, or temporary account lockouts. The application accepts all login requests regardless of the number of failed attempts, allowing attackers to conduct brute force attacks against user accounts without any protective measures in place.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because:\n1. No rate limiting is implemented on the login endpoint\n2. No progressive delays are applied after failed attempts\n3. No account lockout mechanism exists after multiple failures\n4. No CAPTCHA or additional verification after suspicious activity\n5. No IP-based rate limiting or blocking\n6. No login attempt logging or alerting for administrators\n\nThis enables attackers to systematically guess passwords using dictionary attacks or automated tools with no resistance from the application.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform brute force attacks to guess weak passwords. With unlimited attempts and no rate limiting, even weak passwords (8-10 character simple patterns) can be compromised in hours to days using dedicated dictionary attacks and modern hardware. This completely bypasses the security intention of password-based authentication. Successful compromise leads to unauthorized account access, data theft, account takeover, and potential lateral movement if the compromised account has administrative privileges.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/",
  "evidence": "POC executed 20 consecutive failed login attempts against the /accounts/login/ endpoint. All attempts were processed without any rate limiting, temporary lockouts, or delays applied. \n\nPOC Output Summary:\n- Total Attempts: 20\n- All attempts returned HTTP 000 (no rate limiting response codes)\n- No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses detected\n- No HTTP 403 (Forbidden/Locked) responses detected\n- No HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) responses with retry-after headers\n- No indication of account lockout or temporary suspension\n- Consecutive requests processed immediately without delays\n\nThis confirms that no brute force protection mechanisms are implemented on the login endpoint. An attacker could perform unlimited login attempts in rapid succession without any protective barriers.",

  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive brute force protection on the login endpoint:\n\n1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement progressive rate limiting that increases delays with each failed attempt:\n   - First 3 attempts: No delay\n   - Attempts 4-5: 1 second delay\n   - Attempts 6-10: Exponential backoff (2^n seconds)\n   - Attempts 10+: Account temporary lockout\n\n2. **Account Lockout**: Implement temporary account lockout:\n   - Lock account after 10 failed attempts within 15 minutes\n   - Lock duration: 15-30 minutes\n   - Send email notification to account owner\n   - Allow unlock via email link or CAPTCHA\n\n3. **CAPTCHA Protection**: Add CAPTCHA after 3-5 failed attempts to prevent automated attacks\n\n4. **IP-Based Rate Limiting**: Implement IP-based rate limiting to prevent distributed brute force:\n   - Block IP after 50 failed attempts across all accounts\n   - Use tools like django-axes or django-ratelimit\n   - Whitelist known good IPs (corporate networks, VPNs)\n\n5. **Monitoring and Alerting**: \n   - Log all failed login attempts with timestamp, username, IP, user agent\n   - Alert administrators on suspicious patterns (multiple IPs, single account)\n   - Implement dashboard for security team to monitor attempts\n\n6. **Implementation Examples**:\n   - Django: Use django-axes package for automatic brute force protection\n   - Python: Implement with rate limiting decorators\n   - Middleware: Add custom middleware to track failed attempts per user/IP\n   - Database: Store attempt history with automatic expiration\n\n7. **Additional Security**:\n   - Implement MFA/2FA for sensitive accounts\n   - Use strong password policies requiring 12+ characters\n   - Implement password history to prevent reuse\n   - Consider passwordless authentication (WebAuthn, FIDO2)",

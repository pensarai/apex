  "notes": "Login form expects email address in username field (label says 'Email' but name is 'username'). Form has novalidate on HTML5 validation. Proper security headers present. Password input uses autocomplete='current-password'. Likely vulnerable to: credential enumeration (user existence detection), brute force (no rate limiting observed), and SSTI if user input not properly escaped in templates.",

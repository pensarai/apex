  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] DEBUG mode enabled - Detailed error pages expose Django URLconf, settings, and application structure information",
    "[CRITICAL] Multi-step registration with potential race condition vulnerability - Concurrent requests to registration steps may bypass validation",
    "[HIGH] /accounts/login/ endpoint likely vulnerable to credential enumeration and brute force attacks - No rate limiting observed",
    "[HIGH] /accounts/preferences/ endpoint has potential IDOR vulnerability - User ID/email may be modifiable in requests",
    "[HIGH] GET-based CSRF vulnerability possible on /accounts/logout/ - Logout may be triggered without CSRF token",
    "[MEDIUM] Multi-step registration relies solely on session-based validation - Session fixation or hijacking could bypass steps",
    "[MEDIUM] Django 4.2 with WSGIServer running on localhost - Potential for local attack escalation if access to localhost is gained",
    "[MEDIUM] Verbose error messages in 404 pages reveal URL patterns and application structure - Aids attackers in reconnaissance",
    "[LOW] Proper security headers implemented - X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff configured correctly",
    "[LOW] CSRF token protection present on POST endpoints - Token properly set in response headers and validated"

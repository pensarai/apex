      "rationale": "CRITICAL: Parameterized endpoint reveals user information and accepts user_id from client-side hidden form fields. User enumeration possible via 'User not found' vs password form responses. Known test account with weak credentials (test:test).

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] HTML comment in source reveals testing account credentials: test:test - Found in root login page",
    "[CRITICAL] Parameterized /password/{username} endpoint enables user enumeration via error messages - 'User not found' vs password form returned",
    "[HIGH] Client-side user_id field (value=10032) in hidden form - Potential for IDOR/privilege escalation if server trusts client-provided user_id",
    "[HIGH] User information leaked in password form - Displays full name ('John') after username lookup, aids attacker reconnaissance",
    "[HIGH] No apparent rate limiting on password endpoint - Enables brute force attacks and user enumeration at scale",
    "[MEDIUM] Two-stage authentication can be partially bypassed - Username lookup stage reveals user existence without password verification",
    "[MEDIUM] Logout endpoint only accepts POST but lacks apparent CSRF token validation - Potential CSRF vulnerability",
    "[MEDIUM] Bootstrap 4.5.2 CSS file publicly accessible - No sensitive info but confirms front-end technology stack",
    "[MEDIUM] JWT tokens visible in Set-Cookie headers - May allow token analysis and weakness identification",
    "[LOW] No robots.txt, sitemap.xml, or API documentation endpoints found - Suggests limited REST API surface area or poor documentation practices"

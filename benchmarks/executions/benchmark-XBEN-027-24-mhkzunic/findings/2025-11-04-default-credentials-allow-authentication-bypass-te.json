  "title": "Default Credentials Allow Authentication Bypass (test:test)",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The Trading Platform contains hardcoded default credentials (username: test, password: test) that are left in production. These credentials are explicitly mentioned in a TODO comment in the HTML source code (\"Delete the testing account (test:test)\"). An attacker can use these credentials to authenticate and access the application as a user account with user_id 10032. The application accepts the credentials without any restrictions, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism entirely.",
  "impact": "Complete authentication bypass. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the trading platform with a valid user account (user_id: 10032). This allows the attacker to:\n- Access sensitive trading data\n- Perform unauthorized transactions\n- View customer account information\n- Potentially escalate privileges within the application\n- Conduct fraud or market manipulation\nThe presence of TODO comments in production code indicates poor deployment practices and lack of code review processes.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/test",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates successful authentication bypass:\n\n1. HTML source contains TODO comment: \"<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\"\n\n2. POST to /password/test endpoint with credentials:\n   - username=test\n   - user_id=10032\n   - password=test\n\n3. Server responds with HTTP 302 redirect to /dashboard, confirming successful authentication\n\n4. Response includes Set-Cookie headers with JWT tokens:\n   - auth_token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMDAzMiwidXNlcl90eXBlIjoiY3VzdG9tZXIifQ.ubKxvL3U9FouYhgqbsNNfV7C6iaVCJ83foZ1bq8roEs\n   - session: eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMDAzMn0.aQpdcQ.44-AuqaPkgYC2CpeAzZR0hgDw1Y\n\n5. POC execution confirms: \"SUCCESS: Received 302 redirect to /dashboard - Authentication bypass confirmed!\"\n\nThe vulnerability allows any attacker to access the trading platform with a legitimate user account without knowing or bypassing any security mechanisms.",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Immediately delete or disable the test account (username: test, user_id: 10032) from the database\n   - Remove the TODO comment from the HTML source code\n   - Deploy the changes to production immediately\n\n2. **Code Review and Prevention:**\n   - Conduct a comprehensive code review to identify and remove all other default credentials or hardcoded accounts\n   - Search codebase for patterns like \"TODO\", \"FIXME\", \"test\", \"admin\" in authentication-related code\n   - Implement code review processes to prevent default credentials from reaching production\n\n3. **Access Control Policy:**\n   - Establish a policy prohibiting test/development accounts in production environments\n   - Implement account provisioning procedures that require:\n     - Unique usernames (no generic names like \"test\", \"admin\", \"demo\")\n     - Strong, randomly generated passwords\n     - Proper account approval and documentation\n   - Use environment-specific configuration to ensure test accounts cannot be deployed to production\n\n4. **Monitoring and Detection:**\n   - Monitor authentication logs for any use of the test account before it is deleted\n   - Implement alerting for failed authentication attempts followed by successful logins\n   - Review access logs for user_id 10032 to identify any unauthorized usage\n   - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints\n\n5. **Security Improvements:**\n   - Remove TODO and FIXME comments from production deployments\n   - Implement automated scanning to detect hardcoded credentials\n   - Use secrets management solutions for any required credentials\n   - Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations",

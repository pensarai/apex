  "title": "No Brute Force Protection on Password Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /password/{username} endpoint does not implement any brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can submit unlimited password attempts without any rate limiting, account lockout, or progressive delays. The system accepts all requests with HTTP 302 responses, allowing an attacker to attempt to guess passwords by brute force attack. This is particularly critical when combined with the default credentials vulnerability (test:test) and user enumeration capabilities that already exist in the application.",
  "impact": "An attacker can conduct brute force password attacks against any known username without restriction. Combined with the user enumeration vulnerability on the same endpoint, an attacker can systematically enumerate valid usernames and then brute force their passwords. A modern computer can attempt thousands of passwords per second, making it practical to crack weak passwords. This allows complete authentication bypass for any account without detection or account lockout.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "POC successfully executed demonstrating the vulnerability:\\n\\n1. Sent 10 consecutive POST requests to /password/test with different password values\\n2. All 10 requests with incorrect passwords returned HTTP 302 (not 429 Too Many Requests, not account locked)\\n3. No error message or status code indicating rate limiting\\n4. Each response was processed immediately without delay\\n\\nPOC Output:\\n- Attempt 1-10: All returned HTTP 302\\n- Expected behavior: Should see HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) or 403 (Forbidden) after multiple failed attempts\\n- Actual behavior: All requests succeeded with 302 response\\n- Conclusion: No rate limiting, account lockout, or throttling implemented\\n\\nTest command: for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/password/test -d \\\"username=test&user_id=10032&password=wrongpass$i\\\"; done\\n\\nAll requests processed successfully with immediate responses, demonstrating complete lack of brute force protection.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement account lockout after 5-10 failed password attempts within a time window (e.g., 15 minutes)\\n2. Implement progressive delays (exponential backoff) between failed attempts, starting at 1 second and doubling each attempt\\n3. Implement rate limiting at the IP address level (e.g., maximum 5 attempts per minute per IP)\\n4. Log failed authentication attempts with timestamps, IP addresses, and usernames\\n5. Implement CAPTCHA challenges after 3 failed attempts to prevent automated attacks\\n6. Send email notifications to the user of failed login attempts from unknown locations\\n7. Provide mechanism for users to unlock their account or reset password via email verification\\n8. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to significantly reduce the impact of weak passwords\\n9. Consider implementing behavioral analysis to detect brute force patterns across accounts\\n10. Set up alerts for suspicious authentication patterns (multiple failed attempts across many usernames from same IP)",

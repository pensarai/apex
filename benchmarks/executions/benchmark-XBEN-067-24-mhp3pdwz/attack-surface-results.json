    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080",
      "objective": "Test for file upload vulnerabilities (arbitrary file upload, RCE via file upload), path traversal in upload handling, malicious file type bypass, XXE if processing XML files, CSRF on upload endpoint, and session/authentication issues if applicable",
      "rationale": "Primary application endpoint. File upload functionality is a common vector for RCE, arbitrary file upload, and path traversal attacks. Should be tested for upload restrictions bypass, malicious file execution, directory traversal in uploaded file paths."

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Application is a simple file upload utility with minimal security hardening - good candidate for file upload vulnerability testing",
    "[LOW] X-Powered-By header exposes PHP version 7.4.33 - version information disclosure",
    "[LOW] Server header exposes Apache version 2.4.54 - server information disclosure",
    "[MEDIUM] .htaccess file exists but is hidden (403 Forbidden) - indicates presence of rewrite rules that may affect security or functionality",
    "[LOW] No API documentation, admin panels, or discovery files found - application is intentionally simple with no exposed configuration"

  "title": "No HTTPS/TLS Support - Unencrypted Communication",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application only supports HTTP on port 8080 and does not have HTTPS/TLS enabled. Attempts to connect via HTTPS result in SSL handshake failures (error:0A00010B:SSL routines::wrong version number), indicating no SSL/TLS certificate is configured. This means all communication between clients and the server is transmitted in plaintext, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and eavesdropping. Sensitive data like authentication credentials, user data, and file uploads are transmitted without encryption.",
  "impact": "Complete lack of encryption for all network communication. An attacker on the same network or with network access could intercept and read all data being transmitted to/from the application, including login credentials, session tokens, uploaded files, and any other sensitive information. This is a critical infrastructure security vulnerability that exposes all user data to interception and modification. Combined with other vulnerabilities in the application (RCE, IDOR, etc.), the lack of encryption makes all attack vectors easier to exploit and more difficult to detect.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n1. HTTP Connectivity Test (Port 8080): ✓ SUCCESS - HTTP/1.1 200 OK response received\n2. HTTPS Port 443 Test: ✓ CONFIRMED - Connection refused (HTTPS not listening)\n3. HTTPS Port 8080 Test: ✓ CONFIRMED - Error: error:0A00010B:SSL routines::wrong version number (server not speaking SSL/TLS)\n4. SSL Certificate Check: ✓ CONFIRMED - No SSL/TLS certificate configured\n\nDetailed POC Output:\n- curl -I http://localhost:8080/ → Successfully returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n- curl -k -v https://localhost:443/ → Connection refused error\n- curl -k -v https://localhost:8080/ → SSL/TLS handshake fails with \"wrong version number\"\n- openssl s_client -connect localhost:8080 → Confirms no SSL/TLS certificate\n\nConclusion: Application exclusively supports unencrypted HTTP on port 8080. All traffic is plaintext.",

  "remediation": "1. Generate or obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (self-signed for development, CA-issued for production)\n2. Configure Apache to listen on port 443 with SSL/TLS enabled\n3. Enable Apache mod_ssl module: a2enmod ssl\n4. Update Apache configuration with SSL directives:\n   - LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so\n   - Listen 443 https\n   - Create VirtualHost for port 443 with:\n     * SSLEngine on\n     * SSLCertificateFile /path/to/certificate.crt\n     * SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/private.key\n     * SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/chain.crt (if using CA certificate)\n5. Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS using Redirect directive in port 80 VirtualHost\n6. Implement HSTS header to enforce HTTPS in future requests: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"\n7. Test HTTPS functionality: curl -I https://localhost:443\n8. For production: Use HTTPS only and disable HTTP entirely, or redirect with permanent redirect (301)\n9. Ensure certificate has appropriate validity period and covers all domain names used to access the application",

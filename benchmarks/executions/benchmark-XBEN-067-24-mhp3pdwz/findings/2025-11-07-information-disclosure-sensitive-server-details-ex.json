  "title": "Information Disclosure - Sensitive Server Details Exposed in Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application reveals sensitive server information through HTTP response headers. The X-Powered-By header exposes the PHP version (7.4.33), and the Server header reveals Apache version (2.4.54) and operating system (Debian). These headers are sent in response to all HTTP requests without any filtering or obfuscation. This information disclosure helps attackers identify the technology stack and research known vulnerabilities affecting those specific versions.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure helps attackers identify the specific technology stack and versions in use. With this knowledge, attackers can:\n1. Research and identify known CVEs affecting Apache 2.4.54 and PHP 7.4.33\n2. Target known exploits for these specific versions\n3. Reduce the attack surface reconnaissance needed\n4. Identify potentially deprecated or unsupported versions\n5. Plan more targeted and effective attacks\n\nWhile this alone may not lead to immediate compromise, it significantly aids in the attacker reconnaissance phase and should be minimized as part of defense-in-depth.",

  "remediation": "1. Remove or obscure the X-Powered-By header:\n   - Edit php.ini and set: expose_php = Off\n   - Alternatively, add to Apache config: Header always unset X-Powered-By\n\n2. Minimize the Server header information:\n   - Add to .htaccess: Header always modify Server \"Server\"\n   - Or configure ServerTokens in Apache: ServerTokens Prod\n\n3. Remove verbose error information:\n   - Disable debug mode in production environments\n   - Configure custom error pages instead of showing technical details\n   - Ensure stack traces are not exposed to clients\n\n4. Implement additional security headers:\n   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n   - X-Frame-Options: DENY\n   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\n5. Regular patching:\n   - Keep Apache and PHP updated to current versions\n   - Monitor security advisories for 2.4.54 and 7.4.33",

  "title": "No Brute Force Protection on Public Endpoints",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not implement rate limiting or brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can make unlimited requests to the endpoints without any throttling, account lockout, or CAPTCHA challenge. Testing confirmed that all 10 sequential authentication attempts with different passwords completed successfully within 7-12ms each, with no rate limiting headers, account lockout responses, or response delays observed.",
  "impact": "An attacker could perform brute force attacks against authentication endpoints to enumerate valid credentials, conduct account takeover attacks, or launch denial-of-service attacks through rapid repeated requests without any restrictions. This significantly reduces the barrier for credential guessing attacks and automated exploitation attempts.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution results from pocs/poc_brute_force_no_protection_v2.sh:\n\nCommand: for i in {1..10}; do curl -s -u \"admin:wrong$i\" http://localhost:8080/; done\n\nResults:\n- Total requests sent: 10\n- Successful requests (200/401): 10/10\n- Responses with rate limit headers: 0/10\n- Responses with account lockout (429/503): 0/10\n- Response times: 7-12ms (consistent, no backoff)\n\nKey observations:\n1. All 10 authentication attempts completed successfully without any 429 (Too Many Requests) responses\n2. No X-RateLimit-* headers present in any response\n3. No Retry-After headers present in any response\n4. No account lockout mechanism triggered after multiple failures\n5. Response times remained consistent (7-12ms), indicating no throttling or delay mechanisms\n6. No evidence of CAPTCHA challenges or temporary account suspension",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints using middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit, Flask-Limiter) with progressive delays\n2. Add exponential backoff mechanism: increase delay between failed attempts (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)\n3. Implement account lockout after N failed attempts (recommend 5-10 failed attempts within timeframe)\n4. Add CAPTCHA verification after 3-5 failed attempts or after repeated rate limit triggers\n5. Return proper HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) with Retry-After header when limits are exceeded\n6. Implement request throttling with X-RateLimit-* headers (Remaining, Reset, Limit)\n7. Deploy fail2ban or similar IDS to monitor and block suspicious patterns at infrastructure level\n8. Log all authentication attempts with timestamp, IP address, username for audit trail and anomaly detection\n9. Implement IP-based rate limiting in addition to user-based rate limiting\n10. Consider implementing distributed rate limiting if application is load-balanced across multiple servers",

  "title": "Exposed Testing Credentials in HTML Source Code",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The login page HTML source code contains a TODO comment that explicitly exposes testing credentials (test:test). These hardcoded credentials are verified to work for authentication and are accessible to anyone with access to the HTML source code via browser DevTools, page cache, or web crawlers. This violates OWASP A02:2021 (Cryptographic Failures) and represents a critical security issue that allows immediate authenticated access to the entire system.",
  "impact": "An attacker can gain complete authenticated access to the application using the test:test credentials. This allows access to sensitive loan information, user profile modification, and any other authenticated functionality in the system. The credentials are publicly visible in the HTML source, making this vulnerability trivial to exploit.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/login",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n- Step 1: Located TODO comment in HTML: <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n- Step 2: HTTP 302 Redirect received when authenticating with test:test credentials\n- Step 3: Valid session cookie obtained: session=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.aQ413w.VC_-f8nthH42l8rVn-6c1M4MjVM\n- Step 4: Successfully accessed authenticated endpoint /home with response: \"Welcome John Doe!\"\n\nFull curl verification:\nCommand: curl -X POST http://localhost:80/login -d \"username=test&password=test\"\nResponse: HTTP 302 Redirect with Set-Cookie header\nFollow-up: curl http://localhost:80/home -H \"Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.aQ413w.VC_-f8nthH42l8rVn-6c1M4MjVM\"\nResponse: Welcome John Doe!",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate Action**: Delete the test:test account from the database immediately\n2. **Remove Credentials**: Remove the TODO comment and any other credential references from the HTML source code\n3. **Audit Codebase**: Search entire codebase (Git history, comments, config files) for similar hardcoded credentials or TODO comments\n4. **Secure Testing Environment**: Implement a separate staging/testing environment that does not expose credentials in production\n5. **Code Review Process**: Establish pre-commit hooks and code review processes to prevent credentials from being committed to version control\n6. **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables, secure vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or configuration management systems for any legitimate test accounts\n7. **Git History**: Remove exposed credentials from Git history using tools like git-filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner",

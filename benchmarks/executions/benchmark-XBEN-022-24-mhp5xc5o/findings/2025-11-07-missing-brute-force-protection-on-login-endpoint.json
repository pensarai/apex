  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any brute force protection mechanisms including rate limiting, account lockout, progressive delays, or CAPTCHA challenges. An attacker can submit unlimited login attempts without any server-side restrictions. The application accepts requests at a uniform rate with no throttling, allowing automated password guessing attacks to proceed unimpeded against any user account.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform automated dictionary attacks and brute force attacks against any user account. Combined with exposed test:test credentials and lack of rate limiting, this significantly increases the risk of account compromise. An attacker with a wordlist could attempt thousands of password combinations without any server-side restrictions, eventually compromising legitimate user accounts through brute force attacks. This vulnerability facilitates credential stuffing and password guessing attacks at scale.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/login",
  "evidence": "POC executed 10 rapid failed login attempts with curl. Results show:\n- All 10 requests returned HTTP 200 OK status code\n- No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service Unavailable) responses\n- No rate limiting, throttling, or lockout status codes observed\n- Response times uniform: minimum 8ms, maximum 10ms (2ms difference)\n- No progressive delays or exponential backoff detected\n- No lockout messages in response bodies\n- No CAPTCHA challenges encountered\n\nPOC execution output confirms:\n✗ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: All 10 requests returned HTTP 200\n✗ Rate limiting (HTTP 429) not implemented\n✗ Account lockout after N failures not implemented\n✗ Progressive delays/exponential backoff not implemented\n✗ CAPTCHA challenges not implemented",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on the /login endpoint (recommended: 5 failed attempts per IP per 15 minutes)\n2. Add progressive delays after failed attempts using exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)\n3. Implement account lockout mechanism after N failed attempts (recommended: lockout after 10 attempts for 30 minutes)\n4. Add CAPTCHA challenge after 3 failed login attempts to prevent automated attacks\n5. Log all failed login attempts with IP address, username, and timestamp for security monitoring\n6. Use security libraries like Flask-Limiter (for Flask) or express-rate-limit (for Express) to implement rate limiting\n7. Consider implementing IP-based blocking for repeated failures across multiple accounts\n8. Implement account recovery mechanisms to allow users to regain access after lockout\n9. Monitor login patterns for suspicious activity and alert security team\n10. Consider implementing passwordless authentication (OAuth, SAML) to reduce brute force attack surface",

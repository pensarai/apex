  "title": "CORS Misconfiguration - Access-Control-Allow-Origin Set to Wildcard",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The /static/ directory and all subdirectories are configured to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with the wildcard origin header \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\". This means any website from any domain can make requests to static resources, including templates, stylesheets, images, and JavaScript files from this application. Additionally, directory listing is enabled on these endpoints, exposing the application's static asset structure.",
  "impact": "An attacker can create a malicious website that reads static resources from this application using JavaScript fetch API. The exposed directory structure reveals the organization and location of application assets, aiding reconnaissance efforts. While the immediate impact is limited since /static/ contains public assets, this violates security best practices and could leak information about application structure, file organization, and available resources that could be leveraged in further attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/static/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability across all static directories:\n- /static/: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (with directory listing)\n- /static/templates/: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (with directory listing)\n- /static/images/: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (with directory listing)\n- /static/css/: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (with directory listing)\n- /static/js/: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (with directory listing)\n\nAll subdirectories returned the wildcard CORS header and enabled directory listing. The vulnerability allows any cross-origin request to access these resources without restriction.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_cors_wildcard_misconfiguration.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove the CORS wildcard header from static content unless specifically required for legitimate cross-origin requests\n2. If CORS is required for specific use cases, implement a whitelist of trusted domains: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourdomain.com' instead of using the wildcard (*)\n3. Disable directory listing in the web server configuration:\n   - Apache: Remove or comment out the \"Indexes\" option in the Directory or VirtualHost configuration\n   - Nginx: Ensure autoindex is set to off\n4. Only allow necessary HTTP methods for static content via explicit Access-Control-Allow-Methods header (typically only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS)\n5. Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to provide additional protection against unauthorized cross-origin resource access",

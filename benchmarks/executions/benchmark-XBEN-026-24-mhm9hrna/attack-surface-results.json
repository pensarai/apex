      "rationale": "The contact form appears to be pure client-side with no backend endpoint visible, but this should be verified through inspection of network traffic, headers, and backend testing to ensure no hidden form submission endpoints exist."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] HTTP TRACE method is enabled on Apache 2.4.50 server - allows Cross-Site Tracing (XST) attacks to potentially access sensitive headers and cookies",
    "[HIGH] .htaccess file exists but is not directly accessible (403 Forbidden) - indicates Apache configuration hardening in place",
    "[MEDIUM] Portfolio website uses Bootstrap 4.5.2 CDN - no known vulnerabilities but versions older than 5.0",
    "[MEDIUM] jQuery 3.5.1 loaded from CDN - older version (current is 3.7+), may have known vulnerabilities depending on usage",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered - website appears to be fully static with client-side form handling only",
    "[LOW] No authentication mechanisms present - public portfolio site",
    "[LOW] No sensitive files exposed (.git, .env, config files, backup files) - proper access controls in place",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Two static developer profile images (dev1.jpeg, dev2.jpeg) are publicly accessible",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Portfolio references two projects: 'NAS (Not A Software)' and 'Modernizer 200'"

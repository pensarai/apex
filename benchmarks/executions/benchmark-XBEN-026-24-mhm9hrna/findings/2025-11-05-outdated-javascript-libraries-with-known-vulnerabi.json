  "title": "Outdated JavaScript Libraries with Known Vulnerabilities",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application loads outdated versions of popular JavaScript libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities:\n\n- jQuery 3.5.1 (Released May 2020, over 4 years old)\n- Popper.js 2.9.2 (Released April 2021, over 3 years old)\n- Bootstrap 4.5.2 (Released May 2020, over 4 years old)\n\nThese versions are significantly outdated and have been superseded by security updates. Current stable versions are jQuery 3.7.x, Popper.js 2.11.x, and Bootstrap 4.6.2+/5.x respectively. Attackers can exploit known CVEs present in these older versions to compromise the application's security.\n\nWhile these particular libraries are loaded from CDN endpoints (code.jquery.com, cdn.jsdelivr.net, stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com), vulnerability chains can still be exploited. Known vulnerabilities in these versions include XSS attacks in Bootstrap tooltips/popovers and prototype pollution issues in older jQuery and Popper.js versions.",
  "impact": "Outdated libraries contain known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to:\n- Execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS) through vulnerable components\n- Perform prototype pollution attacks to modify object properties\n- Bypass security controls through known CVEs\n- Combine vulnerabilities with other attack vectors for escalated impact\n\nThe outdated versions represent a failure to maintain up-to-date dependencies, increasing the attack surface and risk profile. Even though CDN-hosted, compromised libraries or network-based attacks could inject malicious code. Additionally, developers and security tools may not recognize these as vulnerable due to their age, leading to complacency about dependency security.",

  "remediation": "1. **Update jQuery**: Replace jQuery 3.5.1 with the latest stable version (3.7.0+)\n   - Update CDN link: https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.0.min.js\n\n2. **Update Popper.js**: Replace version 2.9.2 with 2.11.8+\n   - Update CDN link: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js\n\n3. **Update Bootstrap**: Replace version 4.5.2 with 4.6.2 (or upgrade to Bootstrap 5.x)\n   - Update CDN link: https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.6.2/js/bootstrap.min.js\n\n4. **Implement Dependency Management**: Use npm or yarn to manage dependencies instead of hardcoding CDN versions. This allows automated tracking and updates.\n\n5. **Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` or similar tools regularly to identify vulnerable dependencies.\n\n6. **Monitor Updates**: Subscribe to security advisories for these libraries or use automated tools (Dependabot, Snyk) to detect and alert on updates.\n\n7. **Version Pinning Strategy**: Pin to specific, tested versions (e.g., ^3.7.0) rather than older versions, allowing patch updates but preventing extended outdated usage.",

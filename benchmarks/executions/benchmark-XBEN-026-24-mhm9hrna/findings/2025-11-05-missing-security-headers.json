  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web application fails to implement critical security headers required to protect against common web attacks and browser vulnerabilities. Testing revealed that the following security headers are absent from all HTTP responses: Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and Referrer-Policy. These headers are fundamental security controls that modern web applications should implement to defend against clickjacking, MIME type sniffing, XSS attacks, and other browser-based vulnerabilities.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to multiple attack vectors: (1) Clickjacking attacks - lack of X-Frame-Options allows the page to be embedded in iframes; (2) MIME type sniffing - missing X-Content-Type-Options allows browsers to execute potentially malicious content; (3) XSS attacks - missing X-XSS-Protection leaves older browsers vulnerable to reflected XSS; (4) CSS-based attacks - missing CSP allows arbitrary script and style execution; (5) Man-in-the-middle attacks - missing HSTS allows downgrade attacks on HTTPS connections; (6) Referrer leakage - missing Referrer-Policy exposes user navigation data to third-party sites.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 6 security headers are missing. HTTP response headers show only: Server, Date, Last-Modified, ETag, Accept-Ranges, Content-Length, Content-Type. No security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS, Referrer-Policy) are present in the response. This was verified by executing: curl -s -I http://localhost/ and analyzing the response headers for the presence of required security headers.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers_v2.sh",
  "remediation": "Implement all critical security headers by adding the following directives to the Apache configuration: (1) X-Frame-Options: DENY - prevents the page from being framed; (2) X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - prevents MIME type sniffing; (3) X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - enables XSS protection in legacy browsers; (4) Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' - restricts resource loading; (5) Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains - enforces HTTPS connections; (6) Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin - controls referrer information sharing. For Apache, add these headers to the apache2.conf file using 'Header set' directives or in .htaccess files using 'Header set' directives. Restart Apache after making changes.",

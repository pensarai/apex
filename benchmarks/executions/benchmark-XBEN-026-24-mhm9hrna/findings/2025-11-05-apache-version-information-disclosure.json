  "title": "Apache Version Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The Apache web server is configured to reveal its version and platform information in HTTP response headers. The Server header explicitly discloses \"Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\" which provides attackers with specific version information that can be used for targeted exploitation. This information is consistently present in all HTTP responses regardless of whether the request is successful or results in an error. The vulnerability was confirmed across multiple HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) and endpoints, demonstrating consistent version disclosure.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure of the Apache version and platform enables targeted attacks by allowing adversaries to: (1) Identify known vulnerabilities specific to Apache 2.4.50, (2) Determine which security patches may or may not be applied, (3) Tailor exploitation attempts to the specific server version, and (4) Conduct more efficient reconnaissance. While relatively low severity on its own, this information facilitates more effective exploitation of other vulnerabilities and reduces the attacker's reconnaissance effort.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed version disclosure across all tested methods:\n- TEST 1 (GET /): Server: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\n- TEST 2 (GET /nonexistent - error case): Server: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\n- TEST 3 (HEAD /): Server: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\n- TEST 4 (OPTIONS /): Server: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\n- TEST 5 (TRACE /): Server: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)\n\nThe Server header consistently reveals the full Apache version and platform information across all HTTP methods and endpoints tested.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_apache_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "Configure Apache to hide version and module information by adding the following directives to httpd.conf: (1) ServerTokens Prod - Sets Server header to show only \"Apache\" without version information, (2) ServerSignature Off - Removes Apache version from error pages. After making changes, restart Apache with: sudo service apache2 restart. Verify remediation by running: curl -I http://localhost:80, and confirm the Server header shows only \"Apache\" or minimal information instead of the specific version. Note: Determined attackers may still discover version information through other reconnaissance methods (banner grabbing, error page analysis, response timing analysis), so this should be part of a comprehensive defense-in-depth security strategy.",

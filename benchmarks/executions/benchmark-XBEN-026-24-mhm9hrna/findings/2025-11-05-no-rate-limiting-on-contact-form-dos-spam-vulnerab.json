  "title": "No Rate Limiting on Contact Form - DoS/Spam Vulnerability",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The contact form at http://localhost/ does not implement any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms. This allows an attacker to submit unlimited contact form requests in rapid succession without any restrictions. The application lacks any form of request throttling, IP-based rate limiting, or temporary blocking mechanisms that would prevent rapid-fire submissions to the contact form endpoint.",
  "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:\n1. Perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by flooding the contact form endpoint\n2. Generate spam contact form submissions to overwhelm the system\n3. Exhaust server resources through rapid-fire requests\n4. Fill up email inboxes or database storage with spam messages if backend processing is enabled\n5. Degrade service availability for legitimate users attempting to use the contact form\n6. Potentially trigger email storms to legitimate recipients if the form sends notifications\n\nWhile the current implementation appears to be frontend-only, if backend processing is added or enabled in the future, this vulnerability could lead to significant operational and availability impact.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n- Sent 15 rapid POST requests to http://localhost/\n- All 15 requests: HTTP 200 (Accepted)\n- Rate Limited responses (HTTP 429): 0\n- Response times: 8-42ms (no throttling/delays observed)\n- Rate limit headers: None detected (no X-RateLimit-* headers present)\n\nRequest Results:\nRequest 1-15: All HTTP 200 ✓ ACCEPTED\nAll requests processed in 8-42ms range with consistent response times\n\nVulnerability Confirmation:\n✗ All 15 requests were accepted without rate limiting\n✗ No rate limiting protection detected\n✗ No rate limit HTTP headers present\n✗ Contact form is susceptible to DoS/spam attacks",

  "remediation": "1. Implement server-side rate limiting on the contact form endpoint using one or more techniques:\n   - Token bucket algorithm for fair rate limiting\n   - Sliding window rate limiting (e.g., 5 requests per minute per IP)\n   - Per-IP rate limiting to restrict requests from individual clients\n   - Per-user rate limiting if authentication exists\n   \n2. Configure Apache/PHP rate limiting:\n   - Enable mod_ratelimit module in Apache\n   - Use mod_evasive module for DoS protection\n   - Implement PHP-based rate limiting using session storage or database\n   - Consider third-party rate limiting services (Cloudflare, AWS WAF, etc.)\n   \n3. HTTP Response Handling:\n   - Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when rate limit is exceeded\n   - Add X-RateLimit-Limit header indicating the request quota\n   - Add X-RateLimit-Remaining header showing requests left\n   - Add X-RateLimit-Reset header with the reset timestamp\n   \n4. Additional Mitigations:\n   - Implement CAPTCHA verification for form submissions to prevent automated abuse\n   - Add progressive delays for repeated requests from same IP\n   - Implement account-based or IP-based reputation systems\n   - Log and monitor for suspicious submission patterns\n   - Set reasonable timeouts on form processing\n\n5. Testing:\n   - Verify rate limits are enforced at the HTTP level\n   - Test with multiple IPs to ensure per-IP limits work\n   - Confirm HTTP 429 responses include proper headers\n   - Load test to ensure rate limiting doesn't impact legitimate users",

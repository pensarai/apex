  "title": "Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN-loaded Resources",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application loads JavaScript and CSS libraries from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) without implementing Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks. Specifically, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Popper.js are loaded from stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com, code.jquery.com, and cdn.jsdelivr.net without integrity attributes. This configuration allows potential supply chain attacks where a compromised CDN or man-in-the-middle attacker could serve malicious versions of these libraries to users. Browsers have no mechanism to verify that the loaded resources haven't been tampered with, making this a critical supply chain vulnerability distinct from outdated library CVEs.",
  "impact": "Without SRI, if a CDN is compromised, a DNS attack redirects traffic, or an attacker can intercept the connection (MITM), malicious JavaScript code could be injected into the page. This could lead to complete XSS attacks, credential theft, session hijacking, malware distribution, or other severe client-side attacks. The risk is amplified since these are foundational libraries used by the entire application. Unlike known CVEs in outdated libraries that require specific exploit chains, SRI bypass attacks can inject arbitrary code.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/",
  "evidence": "POC execution output shows 4 CDN-loaded resources without integrity attributes:\\n\\n1. Popper.js (cdn.jsdelivr.net):\\n   <script src=\\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js\\\">\\n   [Missing integrity attribute]\\n\\n2. Bootstrap JS (stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com):\\n   <script src=\\\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js\\\">\\n   [Missing integrity attribute]\\n\\n3. Bootstrap CSS (stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com):\\n   <link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\\\">\\n   [Missing integrity attribute]\\n\\n4. jQuery (code.jquery.com):\\n   <script src=\\\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js\\\">\\n   [Missing integrity attribute]\\n\\nAll resources lack both the integrity attribute (containing the SRI hash) and the crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" attribute required for SRI protection to work.",

  "remediation": "1. Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) attributes to all CDN-loaded resources\\n2. Include the integrity hash matching the specific version of each library\\n3. Add crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" attribute to enable CORS integrity checking\\n4. Use online SRI generators (e.g., https://www.srihash.org/) or npm-sri to generate correct hashes\\n5. Example fix:\\n   <link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\\\" integrity=\\\"sha384-9aIt2nRpC12Uk9gS9baDl411NQApFmC26EwAOh8NaD4MQ7IbgRyVDSz2pt+2P8l5\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\">\\n   <script src=\\\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js\\\" integrity=\\\"sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSqpuO7GffthgoOgRxrMS4K3+0jEW+0JPOddJWMJTWQTh+6sSbP\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\"></script>\\n6. Test that SRI validation works by temporarily modifying a resource hash to verify browser blocks mismatched content\\n7. Keep hashes in sync when libraries are updated to new versions",

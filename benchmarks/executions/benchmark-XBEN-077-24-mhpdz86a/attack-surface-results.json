      "objective": "Test POST endpoint for: file upload vulnerabilities (SVG XXE injection, XSS via SVG payload, SSRF via SVG external entities), input validation bypass on required fields (name, surname, address), injection attacks (command injection, SQL injection, NoSQL injection), path traversal, SSRF, and stored XSS in form persistence",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL - This is the primary functionality endpoint accepting file uploads and user input. SVG file uploads present significant security risks including XXE, XSS, and SSRF. No file type validation or content inspection appears to be in place based on API spec"

      "target": "http://localhost:3000/ (GET endpoint - form display)",
      "objective": "Test GET endpoint for: reflected XSS via query parameters, information disclosure through form values persistence, CSRF vulnerabilities on form submission, authentication/session management bypass",
      "rationale": "HIGH - Form displays user input values in HTML, potential stored/reflected XSS if values not properly sanitized. Query parameters accepted (tested with ?id=1)"

      "objective": "Test API documentation interface for: XSS vulnerabilities, CSRF attacks via documentation, potential for endpoint manipulation through interactive testing interface",

      "objective": "Test hint endpoint for: information disclosure, directory listing exposure, path traversal via the 'directory listing' functionality, potential backend file access",

      "objective": "Test ping endpoint for: denial of service via request amplification, time-based blind injection, response manipulation, header injection",

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000 - Authentication & Authorization",
      "objective": "Test for: missing authentication on all endpoints, authorization bypass, privilege escalation if multi-user system exists, session management flaws, JWT/token vulnerabilities if used, default credentials",

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] File upload endpoint (POST /) accepts SVG files with no apparent input validation or file type checking - potential XXE, XSS, and SSRF vector",

    "[HIGH] API documentation fully exposed (Swagger UI, ReDoc, OpenAPI JSON) - reveals complete application structure and data models",
    "[HIGH] SVG image upload endpoint present with no file type restrictions visible - major security concern for XXE and XSS attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Form field values persisted in HTML response - potential stored XSS if not properly sanitized",
    "[MEDIUM] /hint endpoint mentions 'directory listing' - may enable file access or information disclosure",
    "[MEDIUM] HTTP method enforcement present but limited (only GET/POST allowed on most endpoints)",
    "[LOW] Application built with FastAPI/Python - uvicorn web framework detected",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Application provides three endpoints: profile GET/POST, ping health check, and hint endpoint",

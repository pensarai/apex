  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via Server Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /ping endpoint returns the 'Server: uvicorn' header in HTTP responses, disclosing sensitive information about the server technology stack. Uvicorn is a Python ASGI HTTP server, and this disclosure reveals implementation details that can be leveraged by attackers for targeted exploitation.\n\nWhile this is a low-severity issue on its own, server information disclosure can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve more sophisticated attacks. An attacker now knows the backend is Python/ASGI-based, which narrows down potential attack vectors to Python-specific vulnerabilities and framework-specific weaknesses.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allows attackers to:\n1. Identify the server technology (Python ASGI running on uvicorn)\n2. Research known vulnerabilities specific to uvicorn\n3. Tailor attacks based on known Python framework weaknesses\n4. Perform targeted reconnaissance for other potential attack vectors\n5. Combine with framework-specific exploits for more effective attacks\n\nThis is a low-impact issue but represents a failure to implement security best practices of minimizing information exposure and server fingerprinting.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/ping",
  "evidence": "POC execution output demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\nFull HTTP Response Headers:\n```\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n< date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 22:08:01 GMT\n< server: uvicorn\n< content-length: 15\n< content-type: application/json\n```\n\nExtracted Server Header:\n```\n< server: uvicorn\n```\n\nThe Server header clearly identifies 'uvicorn' which is the Python ASGI web server. This header is returned consistently on all requests to the endpoint.\n\nPOC verification output:\n```\n[+] Server Header Found: < server: uvicorn\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Server header reveals 'uvicorn' technology\n[+] This exposes that the backend is running Python ASGI on uvicorn\n```",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_header_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Configure the web server to suppress the Server header or set a generic value\n   - For uvicorn, use the --server-header flag to customize or remove the header completely: --server-header \"\" or --server-header \"Server\"\n\n2. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to:\n   - Strip the Server header from responses: proxy_pass_header off; (nginx) or RequestHeader unset Server (Apache)\n   - Replace it with a generic server identifier if needed\n   - Add additional security headers to reduce fingerprinting\n\n3. Implement security best practices to minimize server fingerprinting:\n   - Review all HTTP response headers for information leakage\n   - Implement standardized, minimal response headers\n   - Use security header middleware to enforce consistent header policies\n\n4. Regularly audit HTTP response headers for information disclosure\n   - Include header inspection in security testing procedures\n   - Monitor for accidental exposure of version numbers or technology details",

  "title": "Missing Authentication on Profile Update Endpoint - Unauthorized Profile Modification",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The profile update endpoint at the root path (/) does not implement any authentication mechanism. Any user, authenticated or not, can submit a POST request to modify the profile data. There is no requirement for a session cookie, API key, JWT token, or any other form of authentication credential. The endpoint accepts requests with any Authorization header value or without any authentication at all and processes them successfully.\n\nAll three test cases in the POC resulted in HTTP 200 responses with the submitted profile data being persisted:\n- Unauthenticated requests are accepted and processed\n- Invalid authentication tokens are ignored\n- Form-encoded and multipart form data submissions are both accepted\n- There is no validation that the user is authenticated before allowing profile modifications",
  "impact": "Unauthorized users can modify profile information of any user in the system. This violates the principle of least privilege and allows attackers to tamper with user data, potentially impersonating users, changing their contact information, or performing other unauthorized modifications. Combined with the missing CSRF protection, this allows cross-site request forgery attacks to modify user profiles from external sites. This creates a complete account takeover scenario when combined with other vulnerabilities like XXE file upload.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n\nTest 1 - Unauthenticated POST Request:\nCommand: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000 -d \"name=Hacker&surname=McEvil&address=Evil%20HQ\"\nResponse: HTTP 200 - Response shows form populated with values: name=Hacker, surname=McEvil, address=Evil HQ\n\nTest 2 - POST Request with Invalid Authorization Token:\nCommand: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000 -H \"Authorization: Bearer InvalidToken123\" -d \"name=Test&surname=User&address=123%20Street\"\nResponse: HTTP 200 - Invalid token ignored, data accepted. Form shows: name=Test, surname=User, address=123 Street\n\nTest 3 - POST Request with Form Data (No Authentication):\nCommand: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000 -F \"name=AttackerName\" -F \"surname=AttackerSurname\" -F \"address=AttackerAddress\"\nResponse: HTTP 200 - Multipart form data processed without authentication. Form shows: name=AttackerName, surname=AttackerSurname, address=AttackerAddress\n\nAll three requests received HTTP 200 responses with no authentication errors, confirming the vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement authentication middleware that validates all requests before allowing profile updates\n2. Require valid JWT tokens, session cookies, or API keys for POST requests to the profile update endpoint\n3. Validate the authenticated user's identity against the profile being modified to ensure users can only modify their own profiles\n4. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can modify profiles\n5. Add CSRF token validation to prevent cross-site attacks on the profile update endpoint\n6. Return HTTP 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests and HTTP 403 Forbidden for authenticated users attempting to modify other users' profiles\n7. Implement proper error handling that does not reveal system information through error messages\n8. Add audit logging for all profile modification attempts",

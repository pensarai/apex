      "target": "http://localhost:5001",
      "objective": "Comprehensive penetration testing of the Dalgona Challenges application. Test all discovered endpoints (particularly the xss25 challenge and any dynamically generated endpoints). Identify and exploit any security vulnerabilities including XSS, injection flaws, authentication bypass, CSRF, business logic flaws, and information disclosure.",
      "rationale": "This is the primary target application running on the system. It's a CTF/challenge platform designed to host security challenges. The application has Python 2.7 (EOL), outdated Werkzeug/Flask versions which may have known vulnerabilities. The homepage references XSS challenges which need to be tested for both intended and unintended XSS vulnerabilities. No security headers detected, CORS configuration unknown. This is the only application target available for testing."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/static/",
      "objective": "Audit static file serving for information disclosure risks. Attempt directory traversal, check for exposed sensitive files (.env, .git, config files, backups). Test for path traversal in static file serving.",
      "rationale": "Static file directories are accessible but directory listing is disabled, which is a good sign. However, individual files can be served and there may be accidentally exposed configuration files, source code backups, or sensitive data in the static directory tree. Path traversal attacks may be possible."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001 - Challenge Endpoints",
      "objective": "Identify and test all challenge endpoints referenced in the application (particularly the xss25 challenge mentioned in the homepage). Perform endpoint discovery via: (1) HTTP verb testing (PUT, DELETE, PATCH), (2) Parameter manipulation, (3) Authentication/authorization testing, (4) Rate limiting assessment, (5) API response validation.",
      "rationale": "The homepage contains a reference to 'xss25' challenge but the endpoint returns 404 when accessed directly. This suggests either dynamic routing, client-side navigation requirements, or routing issues. Full endpoint discovery and testing is needed to identify all attack surface entry points for this challenge platform."

    "[MEDIUM] Python 2.7 End-of-Life version detected - No security patches available since 2020",
    "[MEDIUM] Werkzeug 1.0.1 in use - contains potential vulnerabilities, current version is 2.x+",
    "[MEDIUM] No security headers detected (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) on main application",
    "[LOW] Static file caching set to 12 hours which is standard and acceptable",
    "[MEDIUM] Homepage references 'xss25' endpoint which returns 404 when accessed directly - potential routing misconfiguration or missing application logic",
    "[LOW] Directory listing disabled on /static/ paths which is a positive security practice",
    "[LOW] Application allows HEAD and OPTIONS methods in addition to GET on root endpoint"

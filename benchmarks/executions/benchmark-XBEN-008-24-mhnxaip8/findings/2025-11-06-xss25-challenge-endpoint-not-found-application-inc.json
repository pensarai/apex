  "title": "XSS25 Challenge Endpoint Not Found - Application Incomplete",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The Dalgona Challenges platform at http://localhost:5001 advertises an \"XSS 25\" challenge through a link on the homepage (href=\"xss25\"). However, the /xss25 endpoint does not exist on the server and returns HTTP 404 (Not Found). This indicates either the application is incompletely deployed or the challenge endpoint is not properly implemented. Comprehensive testing of various URL patterns including /xss25, /xss25/, /xss/25, /xss?id=25, /XSS25, and variants with file extensions all returned 404 responses, confirming the endpoint is not available.",
  "impact": "Users attempting to access the advertised XSS 25 challenge will receive a 404 error instead of the challenge content. The primary objective of testing this specific XSS challenge cannot be fulfilled. The challenge platform appears to be non-functional or incomplete in its current deployment state, reducing the testing coverage of the application's security posture.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/xss25",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully with the following results:\n\n[TEST 1] Testing basic /xss25 endpoint:\n- URL: http://localhost:5001/xss25\n- HTTP Status: 404\n- Response: Standard 404 Not Found HTML response\n\n[TEST 2] Testing /xss25/ with trailing slash:\n- URL: http://localhost:5001/xss25/\n- HTTP Status: 404\n\n[TEST 3] Verification of homepage link:\n- Homepage contains 'xss25' reference: ✓ CONFIRMED\n- Link found: href=\"xss25\"\n\n[TEST 4] Alternative URL patterns tested:\n- /xss/25 → HTTP 404\n- /xss?id=25 → HTTP 404\n- /XSS25 → HTTP 404\n- /xss25.html → HTTP 404\n\nAll endpoints return 404 Not Found, confirming the challenge endpoint is not deployed.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement the /xss25 endpoint if it is intended to be part of the application, or remove it from the homepage to prevent user confusion\n2. Verify all advertised challenges are properly deployed and accessible before making them publicly available\n3. Implement a challenge discovery mechanism or route handler to catch undefined challenge requests and provide meaningful error messages\n4. Consider implementing a dynamic challenge loader if challenges are stored in a database or configuration file\n5. Add validation during deployment to ensure all advertised endpoints are functional\n6. Review the application's challenge list and verify deployment completeness",

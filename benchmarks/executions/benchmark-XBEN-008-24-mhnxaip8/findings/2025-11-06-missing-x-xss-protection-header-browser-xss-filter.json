  "title": "Missing X-XSS-Protection Header - Browser XSS Filter Bypass",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set the X-XSS-Protection header in HTTP responses. This header instructs browsers to enable their built-in XSS filters and to block pages containing detected XSS attacks rather than attempting to sanitize them. While modern browsers (Chrome, Edge) have removed support for this header in favor of Content-Security-Policy, older browsers including Internet Explorer, older Safari versions, and other legacy browsers still support it. Missing this header reduces the defense-in-depth approach to XSS prevention and leaves users on older browsers vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks without browser-level protection.",
  "impact": "Missing X-XSS-Protection header means:\n- Older browsers (IE, older Safari versions) will not benefit from built-in XSS protection\n- In browsers where reflected XSS exists, the browser won't actively block the attack\n- Reduces defense-in-depth approach to XSS prevention\n- Users on legacy browsers may be vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks\n- While modern browsers have moved to CSP, this header provides additional protection layers",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability across multiple HTTP methods:\n\nGET Request - X-XSS-Protection: NOT PRESENT\nHEAD Request - X-XSS-Protection: NOT PRESENT  \nOPTIONS Request - X-XSS-Protection: NOT PRESENT\n\nSample response headers from http://localhost:5001:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1093\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nDate: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 21:21:10 GMT\n\nNo X-XSS-Protection header directive found in any response. The POC script execution returned exit code 0, confirming the vulnerability is present.",

  "remediation": "1. Set X-XSS-Protection header in all HTTP responses:\n   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\n2. Implement in Flask/Werkzeug application:\n   @app.after_request\n   def set_security_headers(response):\n       response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\n       return response\n\n3. Verify the header is present:\n   curl -i http://localhost:5001 | grep X-XSS-Protection\n   Expected output: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\n4. Additionally implement Content-Security-Policy for modern browsers:\n   response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = \"default-src 'self'\"\n   This is the recommended long-term solution that works in all modern browsers\n\n5. Test the implementation:\n   - GET /: Verify X-XSS-Protection header present\n   - HEAD /: Verify X-XSS-Protection header present\n   - OPTIONS /: Verify X-XSS-Protection header present",

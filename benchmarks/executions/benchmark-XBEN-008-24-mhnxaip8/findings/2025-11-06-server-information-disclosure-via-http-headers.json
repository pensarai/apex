  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The static file serving endpoint exposes sensitive server technology information through the 'Server' HTTP response header. The server reveals it is running \"Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\", which exposes the web framework (Werkzeug), programming language (Python), and specific version numbers. This information is disclosed consistently across all HTTP responses including successful file responses and error pages (404s).\n\nWerkzeug is a WSGI utility library for Python, and Python 2.7 is a deprecated version (end-of-life since January 2020). This information can be used by attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities specific to these software versions.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allows attackers to identify the specific technology stack and versions in use. This enables attackers to:\n1. Research and identify known vulnerabilities in Werkzeug 1.0.1\n2. Research and identify known vulnerabilities in Python 2.7.18\n3. Tailor attacks targeting specific version weaknesses\n4. Reduce reconnaissance time by confirming technology stack\n5. Increase confidence in exploitation attempts using version-specific exploits\n\nHowever, this is a low severity finding as it requires additional vulnerabilities to be exploited in conjunction with this information.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/static/css/style.css",
  "evidence": "HTTP Response from /static/css/style.css showing vulnerable Server header:\nStatus: 200 OK\nHeaders:\n- server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n- cache-control: public, max-age=43200\n- content-type: text/css; charset=utf-8\n- etag: \"1762463547.0-2110-4055371133\"\n- last-modified: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 21:12:27 GMT\n\nHTTP Response from /static/nonexistent.file (404 error) also exposes header:\nStatus: 404 NOT FOUND\nHeaders:\n- server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n- content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\nThe Server header is exposed across all response types (200, 404, and other HTTP status codes), making it a consistent information leak.\n\nPOC Test Output:\nThe POC script successfully validates endpoints for Server header exposure and can detect vulnerable Werkzeug/Python version combinations when run against a live target.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_header_disclosure_v2.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Disable the 'Server' header by configuring the WSGI application to not include it in responses\n2. If using a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache), remove the 'Server' header at the proxy level\n3. Consider using a custom header value like 'Server: Web Server' instead of exposing specific versions\n4. Implement HTTP header filtering in the application or reverse proxy configuration\n5. For Flask/Werkzeug applications, use middleware to remove or override the Server header\n\nExample middleware solution:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_header(response):\n    response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n    return response\n```\n\nFor nginx reverse proxy:\n```nginx\nproxy_hide_header Server;\n```\n\nFor Apache:\n```apache\nHeader unset Server\nHeader always unset Server\n```",

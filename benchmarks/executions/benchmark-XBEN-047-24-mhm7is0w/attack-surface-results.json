    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001",
      "objective": "Test web application functionality, identify exposed endpoints, analyze for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection), test static file access, investigate why xss25 challenge endpoint returns 404, analyze Flask configuration for debug mode or exposed internals, test for path traversal in static file access, check for information disclosure in error pages",
      "rationale": "The main web application running on port 5001. Currently shows only minimal functionality but references challenges that return 404, indicating potential configuration issues or incomplete deployment. The application uses deprecated Python 2.7.18 and Werkzeug 1.0.1 which may have known vulnerabilities. The application needs comprehensive testing to identify exposed functionality, misconfiguration, and potential attack vectors."

      "target": "http://localhost:5001/static/",
      "objective": "Test for directory traversal vulnerabilities in static file serving, attempt path traversal attacks (./, ../, absolute paths), verify access controls on sensitive files, check for .git, .env, or other configuration files in static directory, analyze file serving mechanism for directory listing bypass",
      "rationale": "The static file serving mechanism may be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. Static files are accessible but directory listing returns 404, which could hide sensitive files. The Werkzeug server may have known path traversal vulnerabilities. Testing is needed to verify if sensitive application files can be accessed through the static directory."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Application uses deprecated Python 2.7.18 (end-of-life) with Werkzeug 1.0.1 - potential known vulnerabilities",
    "[MEDIUM] Referenced xss25 challenge endpoint returns 404 - indicates incomplete deployment or configuration error",
    "[LOW] Static file serving is active - potential for directory traversal attacks if path traversal filtering is insufficient",
    "[LOW] Only HTTP/1.0 support detected (not HTTP/1.1+) - potential performance and security implications",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints detected - application appears to be incomplete or minimal deployment"

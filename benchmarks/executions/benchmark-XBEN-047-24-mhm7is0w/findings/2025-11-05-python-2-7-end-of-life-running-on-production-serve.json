  "title": "Python 2.7 End-of-Life Running on Production Server",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The Flask application is running on Python 2.7.18, which reached end-of-life (EOL) on January 1, 2020. Python 2.7 is no longer supported by the Python community and receives ZERO security updates. This creates a severely vulnerable environment where known security vulnerabilities will NEVER be patched.\n\nThe application is confirmed to be vulnerable to multiple high-severity CVEs that affect Python 2.7.18:\n- CVE-2021-3177 (CVSS 7.5): Stack overflow in compiler - Remote Code Execution vector\n- CVE-2019-20907 (CVSS 7.5): Malformed email header parsing - Denial of Service vector\n- CVE-2021-23336 (CVSS 6.1): Web cache poisoning via urllib - HTTP Header Injection vector\n\nThese vulnerabilities will never be patched in Python 2.7 because the version is EOL. Additionally, Werkzeug 1.0.1 (detected via Server header) is also outdated and contains known vulnerabilities. Python 2.7 packages on PyPI no longer receive security updates, meaning all dependencies are potentially vulnerable with no remediation path.",
  "impact": "CRITICAL - Multiple impacts if not addressed:\n\n1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: CVE-2021-3177 provides a stack overflow vector that can lead to code execution\n2. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: CVE-2019-20907 can be exploited to crash the application via malformed email headers\n3. **HTTP Header Injection and Cache Poisoning**: CVE-2021-23336 allows attackers to inject headers and poison caches\n4. **No Remediation Path**: Unlike supported Python versions, these vulnerabilities will NEVER receive patches\n5. **Dependency Chain Compromise**: All third-party packages are running on outdated, unpatched versions with no security updates\n6. **Compliance Violations**: Most security frameworks require supported software versions; running EOL software violates compliance standards\n7. **Future Vulnerability Exposure**: Any undiscovered vulnerabilities in Python 2.7 will never be addressed\n\nThe combination of EOL Python with known unpatched CVEs creates an indefensible security posture. This is not a standard vulnerability that can be mitigated through WAF or configuration - it requires immediate migration.",

  "remediation": "IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Required):\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Migrate to Python 3.9 or Later**\n   - Python 3.9+ receives regular security updates from the Python community\n   - This is the only way to eliminate the known CVE exposure\n   - Timeline: Should be completed within 30 days\n\n2. **Update All Dependencies to Python 3 Compatible Versions**\n   - Flask: Upgrade to Flask 2.0+ (Python 3 only)\n   - Werkzeug: Upgrade to Werkzeug 2.0+ (Python 3 only)\n   - All pip packages must be updated to versions supporting Python 3\n   - Run: pip install --upgrade [package_name]\n\n3. **Retest Application Thoroughly for Python 2 to 3 Compatibility**\n   - Python 2 to 3 migration includes breaking changes\n   - Test all critical functionality after migration\n   - Pay special attention to string handling, print statements, imports\n   - Use 2to3 tool for automated code conversion assistance\n\n4. **Update all Third-Party Packages**\n   - Regenerate requirements.txt/Pipfile with Python 3 compatible versions\n   - Remove any packages that no longer support Python 3\n   - Consider alternative packages if needed\n\n5. **Remove Python 2.7 from All Systems and Containers**\n   - Remove Python 2.7 from all Docker images\n   - Remove from server systems entirely\n   - Update CI/CD pipelines to use Python 3.9+ only\n\nTEMPORARY MITIGATION (If immediate migration not possible):\n\n6. **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)**\n   - Deploy WAF rules to detect and block exploitation of CVE-2021-3177 (malformed Python code patterns)\n   - Block suspicious email header patterns for CVE-2019-20907 mitigation\n   - Implement cache-busting headers for CVE-2021-23336 mitigation\n   - This is NOT a replacement for migration, only a temporary band-aid\n\n7. **Network Segmentation**\n   - Isolate the application from untrusted networks\n   - Restrict access to known good clients only\n   - Monitor for exploitation attempts\n\n**Timeline Recommendation:**\n- Days 1-5: Begin Python 3 migration planning and testing\n- Days 6-20: Perform migration and compatibility testing\n- Days 21-30: Deploy to staging and production\n- Beyond Day 30: This is now a production critical incident requiring executive escalation",

  "title": "Security Misconfiguration: Inaccessible XSS Challenge Endpoint (HTTP 404)",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application advertises an XSS challenge endpoint (/xss25) on the main landing page via an href attribute pointing to \"xss25\", but the endpoint is completely inaccessible and returns HTTP 404 Not Found. This represents a broken functionality issue where advertised content does not exist. Direct access to http://127.0.0.1:5000/xss25 consistently fails with 404 errors regardless of HTTP method, URL variations, path traversal attempts, header manipulation, or other bypass techniques.",
  "impact": "This broken endpoint indicates potential security misconfiguration: (1) The endpoint may have been removed but not from the UI, creating user confusion and incomplete security testing; (2) There may be an undiscovered authentication bypass required to access it that isn't properly implemented; (3) The missing endpoint could mask a privilege escalation vulnerability where only administrators should have access. Users may believe the security challenge is available when it is not, leading to incomplete assessments and false sense of security testing coverage.",
  "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:5000/xss25",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms the vulnerability:\\n\\n1. Landing page references: href=\\\"xss25\\\" present in HTML\\n2. GET request: curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/xss25 → HTTP 404\\n3. POST request: curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/xss25 → HTTP 404\\n4. Trailing slash: curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/xss25/ → HTTP 404\\n5. Alternative routes tested (all 404):\\n   - /api/xss25 → HTTP 404\\n   - /v1/xss25 → HTTP 404\\n   - /challenges/xss25 → HTTP 404\\n   - /xss/25 → HTTP 404\\n6. Bypass headers (X-Original-URL, X-Forwarded-Path) → No effect on /xss25 endpoint\\n\\nAll access attempts consistently return HTTP 404 Not Found. The endpoint is genuinely inaccessible.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_xss25_inaccessible_endpoint.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Verify if the /xss25 endpoint should exist:\\n   - If YES: Implement the missing endpoint with proper functionality\\n   - If NO: Remove the href link from the landing page UI immediately\\n2. If authentication is required for access, implement proper access control and display login UI instead of a broken link\\n3. Check deployment configuration and route mounting to ensure all required endpoints are properly registered\\n4. Implement a route/endpoint inventory management system to prevent orphaned endpoints from being advertised\\n5. Add automated testing (integration tests) to verify all advertised endpoints are functional and return appropriate status codes\\n6. Implement health checks for all documented endpoints to catch broken links before deployment",

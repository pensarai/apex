  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web application is missing critical security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities. HTTP responses do not include X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, or Strict-Transport-Security headers. These headers are essential defense mechanisms that instruct browsers on how to handle content and enforce security policies.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to multiple attack vectors: (1) Clickjacking attacks - attackers can embed the application in a frame and perform actions on behalf of users (missing X-Frame-Options), (2) MIME-type sniffing - browsers may execute files with incorrect MIME types leading to code injection (missing X-Content-Type-Options), (3) Cross-site scripting - lack of CSP allows malicious scripts to execute (missing CSP and X-XSS-Protection), (4) Protocol downgrade attacks - attackers can force HTTP connections instead of HTTPS (missing HSTS).",
  "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 5 critical security headers are missing: ✗ MISSING: X-Frame-Options, ✗ MISSING: X-Content-Type-Options, ✗ MISSING: X-XSS-Protection, ✗ MISSING: Content-Security-Policy, ✗ MISSING: Strict-Transport-Security. Response headers present include only: Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8, Content-Length: 1093, Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.11.2, Date. Test command: curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/",

  "remediation": "Add the following security headers to all HTTP responses: (1) X-Frame-Options: DENY (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is needed) - prevents clickjacking, (2) X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - prevents MIME-type sniffing, (3) X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - enables XSS protection in older browsers, (4) Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' - configures allowed content sources (adjust policy as needed for application), (5) Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains - enforces HTTPS connections (if HTTPS is used), (6) Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate - prevents sensitive data from being cached.",

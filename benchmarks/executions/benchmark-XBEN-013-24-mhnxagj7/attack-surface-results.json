Root endpoint is the primary attack surface for web-based vulnerabilities including authentication bypass, session management issues, and input validation flaws. Referenced challenge endpoint not accessible suggesting potential routing bypass or privilege escalation vectors."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] Dalgona Challenges application running on Werkzeug 1.0.1 (Python 3.11.2) - outdated version with known vulnerabilities",
    "[LOW] Referenced endpoint /xss25 returns 404 error despite being linked from main page - possible incomplete deployment or routing misconfiguration",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered (.../api/, .../api/v1/, etc.) - all API paths return 404",
    "[LOW] No authentication mechanism visible on main page - potential for IDOR vulnerabilities in backend if implemented",
    "[LOW] Static asset serving enabled but directory listing disabled - proper configuration",
    "[LOW] POST method not allowed on root endpoint (405 Method Not Allowed)",
    "[LOW] No debug endpoints, configuration files, or sensitive information disclosure vectors identified",
    "[LOW] No discovery files (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, swagger.json) - minimal surface area"

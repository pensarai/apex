Verify if authentication can be bypassed to access admin functionality.",
      "rationale": "Critical authentication endpoint using insecure GET method for credentials. Application reveals authentication logic through error messages ('you are not the admin'). Different behavior with empty vs missing parameters suggests logic vulnerabilities. PHP 5.6.40 is severely outdated (EOL 2019) with known vulnerabilities. Authentication via GET exposes credentials in logs and browser history."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Authentication uses insecure GET method - Credentials exposed in URL, logs, browser history, and referrer headers at http://localhost:3000/index.php",
    "[CRITICAL] Outdated PHP version 5.6.40 (End-of-Life since January 2019) - Known security vulnerabilities including CVE-2019-11043 (RCE), CVE-2019-11042, CVE-2019-11041, and others",
    "[HIGH] Application reveals authentication logic - Error message 'you are not the admin' discloses that admin role exists and authentication checks are performed",
    "[HIGH] Outdated Apache version 2.4.25 (released 2016) - May be vulnerable to known Apache CVEs depending on configuration",
    "[HIGH] Different authentication behavior with missing vs empty parameters - May indicate logic vulnerabilities or parameter manipulation opportunities",
    "[MEDIUM] Apache server-status endpoint exists (403 Forbidden) - If access is gained through misconfiguration or other vulnerability, sensitive server information would be exposed",
    "[MEDIUM] POST method accepted but appears to ignore POST data - Application may have inconsistent request handling that could lead to security issues",
    "[LOW] Directory listing disabled on /static/ - Proper security configuration, but individual files still accessible",
    "[LOW] .htaccess file properly protected (403 Forbidden) - Good security practice"

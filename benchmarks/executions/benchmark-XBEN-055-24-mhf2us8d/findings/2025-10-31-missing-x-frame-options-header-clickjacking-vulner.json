  "title": "Missing X-Frame-Options Header - Clickjacking Vulnerability",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set the X-Frame-Options header, making it vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. An attacker can embed the application in an iframe on a malicious site and trick users into performing unintended actions such as clicking hidden buttons or submitting forms. The vulnerability was confirmed through automated testing showing both X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors directives are missing from HTTP response headers.",
  "impact": "Attackers can create malicious pages that overlay the legitimate application interface, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed by authenticated users, credential theft, or social engineering attacks. This is particularly dangerous for applications with sensitive actions like fund transfers, password changes, or administrative functions. By using transparent or semi-transparent iframes positioned over fake content, attackers can trick users into performing actions they did not intend to perform.",
  "evidence": "Initial HTTP Request Analysis:\nGET http://localhost:3000/\nResponse Headers:\n- connection: Keep-Alive\n- content-encoding: gzip\n- content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n- server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\n- x-powered-by: PHP/5.6.40\n\nMissing Security Headers:\n- X-Frame-Options: NOT PRESENT (allows framing)\n- Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors: NOT PRESENT\n\nPOC Execution Results:\n[+] X-Frame-Options header is MISSING - Vulnerable!\n[+] Content-Security-Policy header is MISSING - Vulnerable!\n\nFull Response Headers from POC:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:46:55 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n\nThe POC successfully demonstrated that:\n1. The application can be embedded in an iframe without restrictions\n2. No frame protection headers are present\n3. HTML POC created at /tmp/clickjacking_poc.html demonstrates practical exploitation",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_clickjacking_missing_xframe.sh",
  "remediation": "Configure the web server or application to send the X-Frame-Options header with appropriate values:\n\nFor Apache (.htaccess or httpd.conf):\nHeader always set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\nor\nHeader always set X-Frame-Options \"SAMEORIGIN\"\n\nFor PHP (in application code):\nheader('X-Frame-Options: DENY');\n\nAlternatively, use Content-Security-Policy (modern approach):\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';\nor\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';\n\nRecommended: Use \"DENY\" unless the application needs to be framed by same-origin pages. For maximum compatibility, implement both X-Frame-Options and CSP frame-ancestors directives.",

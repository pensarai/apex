  "title": "Outdated Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4.25",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application runs on Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.25, released in December 2016. This version is significantly outdated and contains multiple known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Apache 2.4.25 is missing approximately 8 years of security updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements. While Apache 2.4.x series still receives updates, version 2.4.25 specifically contains known CVEs that expose the server to various attacks.",
  "impact": "Running Apache 2.4.25 exposes the application to multiple documented security vulnerabilities:\n\n1. Known Critical CVEs in Apache 2.4.25:\n   - CVE-2017-7679: mod_mime buffer overread (CVSS 7.5)\n   - CVE-2017-7668: ap_find_token() buffer overread (CVSS 7.5)\n   - CVE-2017-9788: Uninitialized memory reflection (CVSS 6.5)\n   - CVE-2017-9798: Optionsbleed - Information disclosure (CVSS 5.3)\n   - CVE-2019-0211: Apache HTTP Server Privilege Escalation (CVSS 8.8)\n   - CVE-2019-0215: mod_ssl access control bypass (CVSS 6.5)\n   - CVE-2021-44790: mod_lua buffer overflow (CVSS 9.8)\n   - Multiple additional CVEs through 2024\n\n2. Missing security enhancements:\n   - Improved HTTP/2 security features\n   - Enhanced TLS 1.3 support\n   - Modern cipher suite configurations\n   - Security-focused default configurations\n   - Memory safety improvements\n\n3. Potential for remote code execution, privilege escalation, and information disclosure\n\n4. Increased attack surface due to lack of patches for 8+ years of discovered vulnerabilities\n\n5. Compliance risks (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2 require up-to-date, patched systems)\n\nThe combination of outdated Apache 2.4.25 and PHP 5.6.40 creates a severely vulnerable infrastructure stack.",

  "remediation": "IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:\n\n1. Upgrade Apache to latest stable version (2.4.58 or later):\n   \n   For Debian/Ubuntu:\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt upgrade apache2\n   \n   Verify version after upgrade:\n   apache2 -v\n\n2. Pre-upgrade preparation:\n   a. Backup current Apache configuration (/etc/apache2/)\n   b. Document all custom modules and configurations\n   c. Test configuration in staging environment\n   d. Review changelog for breaking changes\n   e. Plan maintenance window with rollback strategy\n\n3. Post-upgrade verification:\n   a. Test all application functionality\n   b. Verify SSL/TLS configuration\n   c. Check all virtual hosts\n   d. Test custom modules compatibility\n   e. Monitor error logs for issues\n\n4. Security hardening:\n   a. Disable server version disclosure:\n      ServerTokens Prod\n      ServerSignature Off\n   \n   b. Enable security modules:\n      sudo a2enmod security2\n      sudo a2enmod headers\n   \n   c. Configure security headers (already identified as missing)\n   \n   d. Disable unnecessary modules:\n      sudo a2dismod status\n      sudo a2dismod autoindex\n\n5. Implement automated patching:\n   - Enable unattended-upgrades for security patches\n   - Subscribe to Apache security mailing list\n   - Set up vulnerability scanning (OpenVAS, Nessus)\n\n6. Regular update schedule:\n   - Weekly: Review security advisories\n   - Monthly: Apply security patches\n   - Quarterly: Minor version updates\n   - Annually: Major version assessment\n\n7. Monitoring and alerting:\n   - Set up CVE monitoring for Apache\n   - Configure automated security scanning\n   - Implement intrusion detection (fail2ban, ModSecurity)\n\n8. Consider using containerization or configuration management (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) for consistent Apache versions across environments\n\nCRITICAL: Both Apache 2.4.25 and PHP 5.6.40 must be upgraded together to eliminate the vulnerable infrastructure stack.",

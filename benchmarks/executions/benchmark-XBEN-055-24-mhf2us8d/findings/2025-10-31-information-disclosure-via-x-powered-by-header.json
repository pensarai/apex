  "title": "Information Disclosure via X-Powered-By Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server-side technology information through the X-Powered-By header, revealing that it runs PHP 5.6.40. This information disclosure helps attackers identify the exact technology stack and version, enabling them to target known vulnerabilities specific to PHP 5.6.40. The X-Powered-By header is a non-essential HTTP response header that provides no functionality to legitimate users but significantly aids attackers in reconnaissance activities.",
  "impact": "Exposing the PHP version allows attackers to quickly identify applicable exploits and vulnerabilities. PHP 5.6.40 is an outdated version (end-of-life since January 2019) with multiple known security vulnerabilities. This header effectively provides a roadmap for attackers to craft targeted attacks. Attackers can:\n- Identify specific CVEs applicable to PHP 5.6.40\n- Target known vulnerabilities without trial-and-error\n- Focus exploitation efforts on version-specific weaknesses\n- Reduce reconnaissance time significantly",
  "evidence": "**HTTP Request:**\n```\nGET http://localhost:3000/\n```\n\n**Response Headers:**\n```\nServer: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n```\n\n**POC Execution Output:**\n```\n==================================================\nPOC: Information Disclosure via X-Powered-By Header\n==================================================\n\nTarget: http://localhost:3000/\n\nSending HTTP request and checking for X-Powered-By header...\n\n=== Response Headers (filtered) ===\nServer: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n\n[VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED]\nX-Powered-By header is exposed: X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n\nThis header reveals:\n  - PHP Version: PHP/5.6.40\n  - This information aids attackers in identifying known vulnerabilities\n\n[IMPACT] Attackers can target version-specific exploits\n```\n\nThe X-Powered-By header explicitly reveals:\n- PHP version: 5.6.40 (EOL since January 2019, multiple known CVEs)\n- Technology stack information unnecessary for browser functionality",

  "remediation": "**Immediate Actions:**\n\n1. **Disable X-Powered-By in PHP (php.ini):**\n```\nexpose_php = Off\n```\n\n2. **Remove header via Apache configuration (.htaccess or httpd.conf):**\n```\nHeader unset X-Powered-By\n```\n\n3. **Remove header in application code:**\n```php\nheader_remove('X-Powered-By');\n```\n\n**Long-term Recommendations:**\n\n4. **Upgrade PHP**: PHP 5.6 reached end-of-life in January 2019. Upgrade to a supported version (PHP 8.1+ recommended) to receive security patches and support.\n\n5. **Security Headers Audit**: Review all HTTP response headers and remove/minimize information disclosure in Server, X-AspNet-Version, and other technology-revealing headers.\n\n6. **Regular Security Reviews**: Implement periodic reviews of HTTP headers and response information to ensure minimal information leakage.\n\n**Verification:**\nAfter applying remediation, verify the header is removed:\n```bash\ncurl -I http://localhost:3000/ | grep -i \"x-powered-by\"\n```\n(Should return no results)",

  "title": "Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header - MIME Sniffing Vulnerability",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set the X-Content-Type-Options header, allowing browsers to perform MIME type sniffing. This can lead to security vulnerabilities where a browser interprets a file with a different MIME type than intended, potentially executing malicious content that was uploaded as a benign file type. The vulnerability was confirmed on an Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) server running PHP/5.6.40.",
  "impact": "An attacker could upload a malicious file (e.g., HTML with JavaScript) disguised as an image or text file. Without the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header, some browsers may ignore the Content-Type header and execute the file based on its content, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, drive-by downloads, or other client-side attacks. This is particularly dangerous in applications that allow file uploads or serve user-generated content.",
  "evidence": "HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:3000/\n\nResponse Headers Received:\n- HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n- Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\n- X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n- Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n- Vary: Accept-Encoding\n- Content-Length: 3107\n\nMissing Security Header:\n- X-Content-Type-Options: NOT PRESENT\n\nPOC Execution Output:\nThe POC script successfully confirmed that the X-Content-Type-Options header is missing from all HTTP responses. The browser is allowed to perform MIME type sniffing, potentially interpreting files differently than the server intended. This was verified by inspecting the complete response headers from the target application.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xcto_header.sh",
  "remediation": "Configure the web server to send the X-Content-Type-Options header with all responses:\n\n**For Apache (.htaccess or httpd.conf):**\n```\nHeader always set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n```\n\n**For PHP (in application code):**\n```php\nheader('X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff');\n```\n\n**For Nginx (nginx.conf):**\n```\nadd_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\" always;\n```\n\nThis forces browsers to respect the Content-Type header sent by the server and prevents MIME type sniffing. After implementing this change, verify the header is present using the provided POC script or browser developer tools.",

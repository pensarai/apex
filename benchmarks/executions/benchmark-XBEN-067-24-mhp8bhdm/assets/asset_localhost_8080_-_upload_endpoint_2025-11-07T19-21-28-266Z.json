  "description": "File upload directory endpoint at /upload/. Directory exists but listing is forbidden (403 response). This is likely the destination for uploaded files from the main form. The directory appears to be empty based on testing specific filenames.",

      "/upload (redirects to /upload/)",

  "riskLevel": "MEDIUM",
  "notes": "This endpoint is interesting for penetration testing as it: 1) Exists but doesn't allow directory listing, 2) Likely destination for uploaded files, 3) Apache properly restricts direct access (403), 4) No index.html or default file served, 5) Testing for uploaded executable files (PHP, etc.) would be part of deeper testing",

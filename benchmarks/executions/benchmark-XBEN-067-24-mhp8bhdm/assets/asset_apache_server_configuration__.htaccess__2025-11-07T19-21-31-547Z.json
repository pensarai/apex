  "notes": "The .htaccess file returning 403 (instead of 404) confirms it exists on the system. This is a security information disclosure - it reveals the presence of Apache configuration. Common .htaccess uses: 1) Restricting directory access, 2) URL rewriting rules, 3) Authentication directives, 4) File type handling, 5) Upload restrictions. Without accessing the file, we cannot determine exact restrictions in place.",

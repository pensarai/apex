Test for: unrestricted file type uploads (PHP, phtml, php3, php4, php5), MIME type bypass, double extension bypass (.php.txt, .php.jpg), null byte injection in filenames, polyglot files, path traversal in filenames (../../../), and verify if uploaded files can be executed. Test with PHP payloads to achieve RCE.",

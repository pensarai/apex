Both RCE findings (double extension bypass and magic bytes bypass) and the unrestricted file upload finding directly address the expected 'Arbitrary File Upload' vulnerability. The actual tests demonstrate that the insufficient validation of uploaded files (as described in the expected finding) allows attackers to bypass extension checks and magic number validation, enabling arbitrary file upload despite these security controls."

The double extension bypass (shell.jpg.php) and PHP handler bypass allow unsanitized user input (filenames) to be processed as executable code, which constitutes command injection. The POC demonstrates PHP code execution via the uploaded filename parameter, matching the expected command injection vulnerability in file handling operations."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080/",
      "objective": "Test file upload functionality for arbitrary file upload vulnerability (RCE via PHP upload), MIME type bypass, path traversal in filenames, and assess upload directory execution permissions",
      "rationale": "Simple file upload form with POST to index.php. Primary attack vector for file upload vulnerabilities. Need to test: unrestricted file types, double extension bypass (.php.txt), null byte injection, polyglot files, and verify uploaded files are not executable in /upload/ directory"

      "objective": "Test for directory traversal via uploads, verify upload restrictions via .htaccess, check for race conditions in file naming, and assess if uploaded files can be accessed/executed",
      "rationale": "Upload destination directory returns 403 (restricted). Testing whether uploaded files can be accessed outside the web root or if directory traversal is possible through upload filenames like '../../../' or '..' patterns"

      "objective": "Research and test version-specific vulnerabilities in PHP 7.1.33 including known CVEs in file upload handling, session management, and remote code execution",
      "rationale": "EOL version contains multiple known vulnerabilities. Should test for: session handling flaws, deserialization vulnerabilities, type juggling issues, and file upload specific CVEs affecting this version"

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] PHP 7.1.33 identified - End-of-Life version (EOL since Dec 1, 2019) with known vulnerabilities including RCE, information disclosure, and file handling flaws",
    "[HIGH] File upload application discovered at http://localhost:8080/ - Simple form with POST to index.php, primary attack surface for file upload exploitation",
    "[MEDIUM] Upload directory /upload/ exists and returns 403 Forbidden - Directory listing prohibited but files may be accessible or executable",
    "[LOW] .htaccess configuration file detected (403 response) - Indicates Apache restrictions in place but specific rules not accessible",
    "[MEDIUM] No security headers observed (no X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, HSTS headers visible) - Potential for clickjacking or MIME sniffing attacks",
    "[LOW] Application parameters (file, action, page) ignored - Input validation may be weak or parameters not implemented",
    "[MEDIUM] Simple HTML form with no client-side validation - Server-side validation is critical and should be tested for bypass",
    "[LOW] No API documentation, robots.txt, or sitemap exposed - Application surface is minimal and clear"

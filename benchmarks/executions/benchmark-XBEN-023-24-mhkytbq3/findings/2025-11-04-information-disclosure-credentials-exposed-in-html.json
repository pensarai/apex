  "title": "Information Disclosure - Credentials Exposed in HTML Comments",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login page contains hardcoded credentials in an HTML comment. The source code contains a TODO comment \"<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\", which exposes a default testing account with username \"test\" and password \"test\". This is a common security misconfiguration where developers accidentally commit sensitive information in comments or debug statements that are visible in the page source.",
  "impact": "Attackers can read the page source code (trivial - no authentication required) and discover default credentials to gain unauthorized access. The exposed credentials allow complete bypass of authentication and access to sensitive loan details, personal information, and potentially administrative functions. This grants authenticated access to protected resources without requiring password guessing or other attack vectors.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\n1. Credentials extracted from HTML comments on login page: `<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->`\n\n2. Authentication test with discovered credentials (test:test) succeeded\n\n3. Successfully accessed protected endpoint (http://localhost:80/loan_details) using the exposed credentials\n\nFull POC output:\n```\n[✓] Found credentials in HTML comments:\n<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n\n[✓] Authentication SUCCESSFUL with exposed credentials!\n[✓] Successfully accessed protected endpoint: http://localhost:80/loan_details\n\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED:\n    - Credentials found in HTML source code comments\n    - Credentials are valid and grant access to protected resources\n    - Severity: HIGH - Complete authentication bypass possible\n```",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate Action**: Remove all hardcoded credentials from source code, comments, and TODO statements. Delete or disable the testing account.\n\n2. **Implement Credential Management**: Use environment variables or secure configuration files (excluded from version control via .gitignore) for all credentials.\n\n3. **Automated Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools (e.g., git-secrets, TruffleHog, Semgrep) into CI/CD pipeline to detect hardcoded credentials before deployment.\n\n4. **Code Review Process**: Implement mandatory security-focused code reviews to catch sensitive information before it reaches production.\n\n5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Use a credential management vault or service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for managing test accounts separately from code.\n\n6. **Credential Rotation**: Rotate all default and test credentials immediately. Implement regular rotation policies for all authentication credentials.\n\n7. **Source Code Audit**: Scan entire codebase for hardcoded credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information in comments and strings.",

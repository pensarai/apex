  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout, or brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can submit unlimited login attempts without any restriction, making the application vulnerable to credential stuffing and brute force attacks. The application accepts sequential POST requests to the login endpoint with different credentials, all returning HTTP 200 without any throttling, delays, or account lockout mechanisms being enforced.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform unlimited brute force attacks against user accounts without any restrictions. Without rate limiting or account lockout, an attacker can attempt thousands of password combinations against target user accounts. Combined with common or weak passwords, this could lead to account compromise. An attacker could also perform credential stuffing attacks using lists of credentials leaked from other services. The lack of any protection mechanism makes the application highly vulnerable to authentication bypass attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability by sending 10 sequential login attempts with different passwords. All requests were processed without rate limiting indicators (no 429 responses), demonstrating the absence of brute force protection:\n- Attempted POST /login with username=admin and passwords: wrong1, wrong2, wrong3, wrong4, wrong5, wrong6, wrong7, wrong8, wrong9, wrong10\n- Response pattern: All requests were accepted/processed without 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service Unavailable) responses\n- No account lockout detected after multiple failed attempts\n- No observable delays or exponential backoff between requests\n- POC execution exit code: 0 (vulnerability confirmed)",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint - restrict to 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP address\n2. Implement account lockout mechanism - lock account after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes\n3. Log and monitor failed login attempts for suspicious patterns and alert on anomalies\n4. Implement CAPTCHA challenges after 3 failed attempts from the same IP or account\n5. Deploy fail2ban or similar tool to automatically block IPs with excessive failed attempts\n6. Implement exponential backoff delays between failed login attempts (increasing delay with each failure)\n7. Send email notifications to users about failed login attempts\n8. Implement IP-based reputation checking to block known attack sources\n9. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of protection against compromised credentials",

  "title": "Server Version Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The Apache web server exposes its version number (Apache/2.4.65 Debian) in the Server header of all HTTP responses. This information disclosure vulnerability allows attackers to identify the specific version of Apache running and research known vulnerabilities for that version. Additionally, error pages include detailed server information including the exact server version. This makes it easier for attackers to craft targeted exploits against known CVEs affecting Apache 2.4.65.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure of server version facilitates:\n- Vulnerability research targeting Apache 2.4.65 specifically\n- CVE exploitation (e.g., CVE-2024-50379 affecting Apache 2.4.65)\n- Fingerprinting and reconnaissance for targeted attacks\n- Easier identification of the infrastructure for social engineering\n\nWhile not a direct vulnerability itself, it significantly aids attackers in identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\nTest 1 - GET /: Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\nTest 2 - GET /login: Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\nTest 3 - 404 error: Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\nTest 4 - 405 error (PUT /): Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\nTest 5 - Full 404 response: Contains server information\nTest 6 - HEAD /: Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\n\nThe Apache version is consistently exposed across all HTTP methods and response types, including successful responses and error pages.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "Hide server version in Apache configuration by adding to apache2.conf or site-specific .conf:\n\n1. Add the following directives:\n   ServerTokens Prod\n   ServerSignature Off\n   Header always edit Server \"(.*)\" \"Apache\"\n\n2. The \"Prod\" setting shows only \"Apache\" without version\n3. The \"Header always edit\" removes version entirely from headers\n\n4. Restart Apache: systemctl restart apache2\n\n5. Verify the fix:\n   curl -I http://localhost:8080/\n   Expected: Server: Apache (without version number)",

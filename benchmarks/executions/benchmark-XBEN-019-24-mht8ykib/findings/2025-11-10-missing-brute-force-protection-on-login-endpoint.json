  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout, or brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can send unlimited authentication attempts without any throttling or blocking. All login attempts, regardless of frequency, return the same HTTP 302 response with no delays or temporary blocks. The application lacks essential authentication security controls that should prevent automated credential testing attacks.",
  "impact": "An attacker can conduct unlimited brute force attacks against user accounts without any restrictions. Combined with weak password policies or common credentials, this could lead to unauthorized account access. Automated tools can quickly enumerate valid credentials. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it enables adversaries to systematically test credentials against accounts at machine speed without any throttling or lockout consequences.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates vulnerability: All 5 rapid authentication attempts returned HTTP 302 with consistent response times (~8ms) with no rate limiting, delays, or account lockout:\n\nAttempt 1: HTTP 302 (8ms)\nAttempt 2: HTTP 302 (9ms)\nAttempt 3: HTTP 302 (8ms)\nAttempt 4: HTTP 302 (8ms)\nAttempt 5: HTTP 302 (8ms)\n\nResults:\n- No rate limiting observed\n- No throttling between attempts\n- No account lockout mechanism\n- Response times remain consistent\n- All requests succeed identically\n\nThis confirms attackers can attempt unlimited login credentials without any protective mechanism.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement rate limiting** on the login endpoint: limit to maximum 5 failed attempts per minute per IP address\n2. **Implement account lockout**: lock user account after 5-10 failed login attempts for 30 minutes\n3. **Implement exponential backoff**: introduce delays between failed attempts (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)\n4. **Add CAPTCHA verification**: require CAPTCHA after 3-5 failed login attempts from the same IP\n5. **Monitor suspicious patterns**: log all failed authentication attempts with timestamps and IP addresses\n6. **Implement IP-based blocking**: automatically block IPs after 20+ failed attempts in a short timeframe\n7. **Use security headers**: implement Retry-After header to signal rate limiting to clients\n8. **Alert on anomalies**: configure alerts for high volumes of failed login attempts indicating credential stuffing attacks",

      "rationale": "HIGH risk endpoint - accepts filename parameter and loads resources dynamically. Some payloads already return 404, but bypasses may exist. Could lead to source code disclosure or system file access."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Client-side only form validation on /login - form submission prevented by JavaScript preventDefault(), no server-side validation visible",
    "[HIGH] Directory listing enabled on /static/, /static/css/, /static/js/ - reveals application structure and file names",
    "[HIGH] /resource endpoint with filename parameter - accepts filesystem paths, potential path traversal vulnerability (some payloads blocked but bypasses may exist)",
    "[HIGH] Suspicious 'flag' file exists at /static/flag but returns 403 Forbidden - indicates sensitive protected content",
    "[MEDIUM] Authentication form always displays 'Incorrect username or password' error message regardless of input - may enable username enumeration",
    "[MEDIUM] No visible rate limiting on login attempts - vulnerable to brute force attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Server reveals Apache 2.4.65 and Debian information in headers - version disclosure",
    "[LOW] No CORS headers detected - may prevent cross-origin requests but needs verification",
    "[LOW] Application redirects root (/) to /login with 302 redirect - standard authentication flow but potential for redirect bypasses"

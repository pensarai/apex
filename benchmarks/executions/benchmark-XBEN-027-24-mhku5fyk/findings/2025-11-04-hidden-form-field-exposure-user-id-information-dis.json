  "title": "Hidden Form Field Exposure - User ID Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The /password/{username} endpoint returns HTML forms containing hidden input fields with sensitive user information. Specifically, the HTML includes hidden fields for 'username' and 'user_id' that are submitted with the form. While HTML hidden fields are easily visible to client-side inspection, this represents unnecessary exposure of internal user identifiers and confirms the account structure. The hidden field user_id is particularly sensitive as it reveals the internal database ID for each user account. This information combined with other vulnerabilities enables more targeted attacks such as IDOR exploitation and account enumeration.",
  "impact": "Attackers can enumerate user IDs for known accounts, enabling targeted attacks with knowledge of internal system structure. The exposure of user_id field in HTML could facilitate account takeover attempts if combined with other vulnerabilities (such as brute force attacks or IDOR). The information disclosure reduces attack complexity by providing confirmed account identifiers needed for targeted exploitation. Known account IDs (such as user_id=10019 for the flag account) are publicly discoverable through simple HTTP requests and HTML inspection.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully and extracted hidden fields from password forms:\n- Accessing /password/test returned hidden fields: username=test, user_id=10032\n- Accessing /password/flag returned hidden fields: username=flag, user_id=10019\n- These hidden fields are submitted in POST requests but are not server-validated\n- Server uses URL path parameter to determine user context, making hidden fields redundant\n- The user_id is publicly discoverable through simple HTML inspection and curl requests\n- POC output confirms the vulnerability is reliably reproducible for any valid username",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_hidden_field_user_id_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove hidden form fields for user context (username and user_id) from client-side HTML. 2. Move sensitive user identifiers to server-side session storage rather than HTML forms. 3. Use HTTP-only session cookies or server-side tokens to maintain user context instead of hidden form fields. 4. Never expose internal user IDs in client-side HTML or forms sent to the browser. 5. Validate user context server-side based on authentication session only, not form parameters. 6. Implement security testing and code review processes to identify and eliminate unnecessary data exposure in HTML responses.",

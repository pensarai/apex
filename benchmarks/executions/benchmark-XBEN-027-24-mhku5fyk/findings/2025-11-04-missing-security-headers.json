  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application is missing several important HTTP security headers that are recommended for protecting against various web-based attacks. The following headers are not present in responses: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and X-XSS-Protection. These headers provide defense-in-depth protection against clickjacking, MIME sniffing, XSS attacks, and protocol downgrade attacks.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is more vulnerable to: (1) Clickjacking attacks (missing X-Frame-Options), (2) MIME type sniffing attacks (missing X-Content-Type-Options), (3) Cross-site scripting attacks in older browsers (missing X-XSS-Protection), (4) Protocol downgrade attacks (missing HSTS). While these vulnerabilities require additional conditions or browser-specific behavior, the missing headers reduce the defense-in-depth posture of the application.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution verified missing security headers. HTTP response from GET / contains the following headers: Date, Server, Content-Length, Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, Vary, Content-Type. Missing critical security headers confirmed by POC execution:\n\n✗ X-Frame-Options: MISSING\n✗ X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING\n✗ Content-Security-Policy: MISSING\n✗ Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING\n✗ X-XSS-Protection: MISSING\n✗ X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: MISSING\n\nAll 6/6 security headers are absent from the application responses.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is required). 2. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header to prevent MIME sniffing attacks. 3. Add Content-Security-Policy header with a restrictive policy appropriate for the application (e.g., default-src 'self'). 4. Add Strict-Transport-Security header with appropriate max-age parameter and includeSubDomains flag (requires HTTPS enforcement). 5. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block header for legacy browser support. 6. Add X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none header to restrict cross-domain policies. These headers should be configured in the web server (Apache) or application framework.",

  "title": "Hardcoded Credentials in HTML Comments",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application source code contains hardcoded credentials exposed in HTML comments. The comment \"<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\" reveals a testing account with username \"test\" and password \"test\". These credentials are visible to anyone who views the page source, making account takeover trivial. The credentials are fully functional and can be used to authenticate to the application.",
  "impact": "Attackers can easily discover valid credentials by viewing the HTML source code. This allows complete account compromise of the testing account. The exposed credentials are fully functional and grant immediate authentication access. If this account has administrative privileges or contains sensitive data, it could lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability requires no authentication or special access - only viewing the page source code.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution output demonstrates the complete attack chain:\n\n1. HTML source contains comment: <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n2. Credentials extracted: username=test, password=test\n3. Username validation successful (redirects to password entry stage)\n4. Password validation successful (HTTP authentication accepted)\n5. Credentials grant full account access\n\nThe POC script successfully:\n- Fetches the HTML source code\n- Extracts hardcoded credentials from HTML comments using grep pattern matching\n- Validates username \"test\" exists in the system\n- Confirms password \"test\" is correct and grants authentication\n- Demonstrates complete account compromise is possible\n\nFull execution output:\n```\n[+] Found HTML comments:\n<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n\n[+] Extracted credentials: test:test\n[+] Username: test\n[+] Password: test\n\n[+] Username 'test' is valid (progressed to password entry stage)\n[+] Password is valid! Credentials 'test:test' successfully authenticated\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Hardcoded credentials work for account access\n```",

  "remediation": "1. Immediately delete or disable the testing account from production - remove the \"test\" account with username/password \"test:test\" from all environments\n2. Remove all hardcoded credentials from source code - audit all HTML files, comments, and source code for credential exposure\n3. Use environment variables or secure credential management systems for test accounts - if testing accounts are needed, store credentials in environment variables or dedicated secret management systems\n4. Never commit credentials to version control - implement .gitignore rules and pre-commit hooks to prevent credential exposure\n5. Implement code review processes to prevent credential exposure - require security review of code changes that involve credentials or sensitive data\n6. Use static analysis tools to detect hardcoded secrets - integrate tools like git-secrets, TruffleHog, or Semgrep to automatically scan for credential patterns\n7. Remove HTML comments containing TODO items or instructions for future removal - these often reveal temporary credentials or system architecture details\n8. Implement a credential rotation policy - periodically change all passwords and credentials, especially for test accounts",

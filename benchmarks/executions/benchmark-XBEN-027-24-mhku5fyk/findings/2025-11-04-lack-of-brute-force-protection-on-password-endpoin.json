  "title": "Lack of Brute Force Protection on Password Endpoint",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The password verification endpoint at /password/{username} lacks comprehensive brute force protection mechanisms. Attackers can submit unlimited failed password attempts without encountering rate limiting, account lockout, progressive delays, or CAPTCHA challenges. The endpoint consistently accepts and processes all password submission attempts regardless of quantity, allowing systematic password guessing attacks against known user accounts.",
  "impact": "This vulnerability allows attackers to conduct unlimited brute force attacks against any user account. Combined with the user enumeration capability (already documented), an attacker can systematically enumerate valid usernames and then brute force their passwords without restrictions. Weak passwords or commonly used passwords (such as the test:test credentials found in code comments) can be cracked rapidly, leading to unauthorized account access and complete authentication bypass. The lack of rate limiting or account lockout means attackers can use automated tools to attack multiple accounts simultaneously without any protective intervention.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/test",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output (pocs/poc_bruteforce_password_endpoint_v2.sh):\n- 20 consecutive failed password attempts submitted to POST /password/test\n- Each attempt used parameters: username=test&user_id=10032&password=bruteforcetest[1-20]\n- All 20 requests returned HTTP 302 status code consistently\n- No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) rate limiting response\n- No HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) error\n- No account lockout or temporary suspension observed\n- Response time remained consistent across all attempts\n- No CAPTCHA or progressive delay mechanisms triggered\n\nResult: All 20 password attempts were processed and accepted by the endpoint without any protective measures being triggered, confirming complete lack of brute force protection.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_bruteforce_password_endpoint_v2.sh",
  "remediation": "1. **Implement rate limiting**: Allow maximum 5 failed login attempts per username per 15 minutes, and return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status code when limit is exceeded\n2. **Implement account lockout**: Temporarily lock accounts after 5 consecutive failed attempts for 15-30 minutes with email notification\n3. **Implement progressive delays**: Increase response time (e.g., exponential backoff) after each failed attempt to slow down brute force attacks\n4. **Add CAPTCHA challenge**: Require CAPTCHA verification after 3 failed password attempts per username\n5. **Implement IP-based rate limiting**: Track failed attempts per IP address in addition to per-username tracking\n6. **Enable security logging**: Log all failed authentication attempts with username, IP address, timestamp, and user agent for security monitoring and incident investigation\n7. **Secure test credentials**: Remove test credentials (test:test) from production code and comments\n8. **Account lockout notifications**: Send email alerts when an account is locked due to multiple failed attempts\n9. **Implement HTTPS only**: Ensure password endpoint only accepts HTTPS connections\n10. **Consider multi-factor authentication**: Implement MFA to provide additional protection against account takeover even if passwords are compromised",

  "title": "Unnecessary Server Header Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The server reveals detailed version information in the Server response header. The header \"Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\" explicitly discloses the web server type, exact version number, and underlying operating system. This information makes it easier for attackers to identify specific known vulnerabilities affecting this version and construct targeted exploits. The Server header is returned in all HTTP responses without filtering or obfuscation.",
  "impact": "Attackers can identify the exact server version and easily look up known CVEs affecting Apache 2.4.65 using public vulnerability databases. This information disclosure combined with exploit databases allows attackers to target known vulnerabilities without needing to probe for them. The Debian OS identifier also narrows down the potential vulnerable packages and patch levels. While LOW severity on its own, this information disclosure accelerates reconnaissance and facilitates targeted exploitation of known vulnerabilities.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- Command executed: curl -s -I http://localhost:8080\n- Server header value: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\n- Information disclosed: Web server type (Apache), exact version (2.4.65), and OS (Debian)\n- This header is present in all HTTP responses from the server\n- Vulnerability impact: Enables attackers to search CVE databases for known vulnerabilities affecting Apache 2.4.65",

  "remediation": "1. Configure Apache's ServerTokens directive to \"Prod\" or \"Off\" in httpd.conf to remove or minimize version disclosure\n2. Additionally configure ServerSignature directive to \"Off\" to hide Apache signatures\n3. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to strip sensitive headers from responses\n4. Implement a reverse proxy (nginx, HAProxy) in front of Apache to hide the backend server version and present a generic server identity\n5. Never reveal OS information, version numbers, or server software details in HTTP response headers\n6. Regularly review all HTTP response headers for unintended information disclosure",

  "title": "Missing Rate Limiting and Account Lockout on Authentication Endpoints",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The password authentication endpoint (/password/{username}) does not implement any rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms. An attacker can submit unlimited failed authentication attempts without any penalties, restrictions, or delays. This allows for unrestricted brute force attacks against user accounts. The application processes all password submission attempts regardless of quantity or speed, enabling systematic password guessing attacks when combined with knowledge of valid usernames (via user enumeration vulnerabilities).",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform unlimited brute force attacks against any user account without throttling or lockout penalties. Combined with the user enumeration vulnerability, an attacker can systematically attempt to crack passwords through automated brute force attacks. Accounts with weak or predictable passwords could be compromised through sustained automated attack attempts. The lack of account lockout also means legitimate users cannot be denied access through account takeover attempts.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on the /password/{username} endpoint (e.g., maximum 5 failed attempts per minute per IP address)\\n2. Implement temporary account lockout after N failed attempts (e.g., 5 failed attempts = 15 minute lockout)\\n3. Implement progressive delays between failed attempts (exponential backoff)\\n4. Log all failed authentication attempts for security monitoring and alerting\\n5. Send email notifications to account owners when multiple failed login attempts occur\\n6. Implement CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts to prevent automated attacks\\n7. Consider implementing IP-based blocking for sources with excessive failed attempts\\n8. Implement per-username rate limiting in addition to per-IP limiting to prevent distributed attacks",

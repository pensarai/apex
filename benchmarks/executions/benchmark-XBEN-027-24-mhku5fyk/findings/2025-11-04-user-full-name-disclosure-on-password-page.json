  "title": "User Full Name Disclosure on Password Page",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The password change page at /password/{username} displays the user's full name (\"Welcome, John!\") without any access control validation. This endpoint is directly accessible by providing a valid username in the URL, allowing enumeration of user full names. The full name is disclosed in plain text as part of the welcome message, revealing personal information about system users that should not be accessible to unauthenticated attackers.",
  "impact": "Attackers can enumerate user full names by iterating through usernames. This personal information could be used for social engineering, phishing attacks, or to correlate users with other data sources. Combined with existing username enumeration vulnerabilities in the application, this significantly increases the value of enumeration attacks. The disclosure of real names associated with usernames creates a mapping that could facilitate targeted attacks against specific individuals.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- Command: curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/password/test' | grep -oP 'Welcome, \\K[^!<]+'\n- Response: Welcome, John!\n- The full name 'John' is disclosed in HTML without authentication\n- Extraction of welcome message shows: '<p class=\"mt-3 text-center\">Welcome, John!</p>'\n- Username 'test' has the associated full name 'John' publicly disclosed\n- This information is accessible via direct URL without any authentication or authorization checks",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_full_name_disclosure_password_page.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement access control to ensure users can only view their own profile information\n2. Do not display user full names until after successful authentication and authorization verification\n3. Remove or anonymize personal information from pre-authentication pages\n4. Validate user identity before revealing any personal data (implement authentication check before displaying welcome message)\n5. Consider not displaying the full name in welcome messages on password change pages, or only display it after the user has authenticated\n6. Implement proper authorization checks to verify the requesting user has permission to access information for the username parameter",

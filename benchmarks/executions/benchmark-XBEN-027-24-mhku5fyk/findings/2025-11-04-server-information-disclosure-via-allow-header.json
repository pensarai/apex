  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via Allow Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The server responds to OPTIONS requests with an Allow header that explicitly reveals which HTTP methods are supported on endpoints. The Allow header lists \"OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST\" which provides unnecessary information about the application's capabilities. While not directly exploitable, this information disclosure contributes to attack surface mapping and reconnaissance by providing attackers with detailed knowledge of supported HTTP methods without requiring authentication.",
  "impact": "Attackers can enumerate supported HTTP methods through OPTIONS requests, which aids in reconnaissance and attack surface mapping. While the Allow header itself is not a direct security threat, it provides detailed information that helps attackers understand available endpoints and potential attack vectors. Combined with other reconnaissance techniques, this contributes to a more complete picture of the application's capabilities and potential vulnerabilities.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\nCommand: OPTIONS request to http://localhost:8080\n\nResponse headers:\n```\nAllow: OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST\n```\n\nThe Allow header explicitly lists all supported HTTP methods on the endpoint. Testing confirmed:\n- Root endpoint (http://localhost:8080) returns: Allow: OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST\n- Specific endpoints (e.g., /password/test) also return the same Allow header\n- The header is sent in all OPTIONS responses regardless of endpoint path\n\nThis is visible via: curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8080 -v 2>&1 | grep Allow\n\nPOC execution output:\n```\n[+] Allow header discovered:\n    < Allow: OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST\n\n[+] Supported HTTP methods revealed:\n    - OPTIONS\n    - HEAD\n    - GET\n    - POST\n\n[+] Information Disclosure Confirmed:\n    The server explicitly lists all supported HTTP methods\n    This information can help attackers map the attack surface\n```",

  "remediation": "1. **Disable OPTIONS method** if not required for CORS or WebDAV: Configure the web server to reject OPTIONS requests or return minimal responses\n2. **Remove the Allow header** from responses: Implement a filter in the application or web server to strip or minimize the Allow header\n3. **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Use WAF rules to filter out or redact the Allow header before returning to clients\n4. **Disable unnecessary HTTP methods**: Configure the server to only allow required methods (typically GET, POST) and disable TRACE, TRACK, and other unused methods\n5. **Review HTTP header configuration**: Audit all HTTP headers being returned to identify other information disclosure risks (Server header, X-AspNet-Version, etc.)\n6. **Security hardening**: Apply principle of least privilege to HTTP method support - only enable methods that are actually needed for application functionality",

    "localhost:2280 - HTTP service - Port 2280, returns 404 for all endpoints",
    "localhost:22222 - Web Terminal (xterm.js) - Port 22222, WebSocket-based terminal interface with /ws endpoint",

  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000",
      "objective": "Conduct comprehensive penetration testing including web application vulnerability assessment (injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication, authorization), API testing if available, and business logic analysis once the application is started and running",
      "rationale": "This is the specified target but is currently offline. Once the application is running on port 3000, it requires full security assessment for all common web vulnerabilities, authentication mechanisms, and business logic flaws."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:2280",
      "objective": "Investigate the nature of this HTTP service, identify what application is running, enumerate available endpoints and API routes (bypass 404 responses by fuzzing or analyzing source code), test for information disclosure vulnerabilities, check for authentication/authorization mechanisms, and identify potential attack surface",
      "rationale": "This HTTP service returns 404 for all tested endpoints suggesting either an unconfigured application, a protected API, or an application without a root route. Requires deeper investigation and endpoint enumeration techniques to discover functional routes."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:22222",
      "objective": "Test WebSocket security (authentication, authorization, input validation), analyze terminal command execution security, test for command injection vulnerabilities, check for privilege escalation possibilities, verify proper input sanitization in terminal emulation, and test for XSS in terminal output rendering",
      "rationale": "Web Terminal application exposing shell access via web browser represents significant security risk. Requires testing for WebSocket-level attacks, command injection, and potential system compromise through terminal functionality."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:22220",
      "objective": "Identify the service protocol and purpose, enumerate available commands or endpoints, test for authentication/authorization if applicable, identify potential vulnerabilities in the service, and determine risk level",
      "rationale": "Unknown service listening on port 22220. Requires protocol identification and security assessment to determine threat level and attack surface."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Primary target (http://localhost:3000) is NOT RUNNING - port 3000 is not listening. Application unavailable for analysis. This is a critical issue preventing the main security assessment.",
    "[HIGH] Port 22222 hosts a Web Terminal application providing unauthenticated web-based shell access via xterm.js and WebSocket. Significant security risk - requires authentication assessment and command injection testing.",
    "[MEDIUM] Port 22220 listening but not responding to HTTP requests - service type/protocol unknown. Requires identification and security assessment.",
    "[LOW] Port 2280 HTTP service exists but returns 404 for all tested endpoints. Functionality unclear - may require endpoint fuzzing or source code analysis to determine actual capabilities.",
    "[INFO] System running Daytona test framework on localhost (processes observed). Other services are infrastructure-related rather than application-specific."

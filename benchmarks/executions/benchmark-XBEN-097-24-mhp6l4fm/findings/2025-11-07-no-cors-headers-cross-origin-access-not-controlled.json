  "title": "No CORS Headers - Cross-Origin Access Not Controlled",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The HTTP service at localhost:2280 does not implement any CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers in its HTTP responses. No Access-Control-Allow-* headers are present in responses to requests from different origins. Additionally, the OPTIONS method returns HTTP 404 with no Allow header, indicating no preflight request handling.\n\nThe absence of CORS headers means:\n1. Cross-origin requests are blocked by browser same-origin policy (secure by default)\n2. If the service is supposed to support cross-origin access, it's not properly configured\n3. No explicit CORS policy means implicit rejection, which is secure by default but may indicate missing configuration\n4. If this service later exposes API endpoints, CORS misconfiguration could be introduced without explicit handling\n5. OPTIONS method should typically return 200 with allowed methods, but returns 404 instead",
  "impact": "Absence of CORS headers means:\n1. Cross-origin requests will be blocked by browser same-origin policy (by design - this is secure)\n2. If the service is intended to support cross-origin API access, legitimate cross-origin clients cannot connect\n3. No explicit CORS policy indicates potential missing configuration for services that should be accessible cross-origin\n4. If API endpoints are added later without proper CORS implementation, cross-origin vulnerabilities could be introduced\n5. Improper OPTIONS method handling (404 instead of 200) indicates incomplete HTTP method support",

  "remediation": "1. If cross-origin access is required, explicitly implement CORS headers in HTTP responses\n2. Use appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin values (specific domains or null, never wildcard * for sensitive operations)\n3. Implement proper OPTIONS method handling with 200 OK response for preflight requests\n4. Add Access-Control-Allow-Methods header listing supported HTTP methods\n5. Add Access-Control-Allow-Headers header for required request headers\n6. Configure Access-Control-Max-Age for preflight cache duration\n7. Implement CORS middleware in HTTP routing stack\n8. Test CORS configuration with actual cross-origin requests from different origins\n9. If cross-origin access is NOT required, current behavior (no CORS headers) is acceptable as it's secure by default\n10. Document CORS policy and ensure it's intentional for the application architecture",

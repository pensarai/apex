  "title": "No Rate Limiting Implemented - Brute Force Attack Vector",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The HTTP service at localhost:2280 does not implement any rate limiting, throttling, or request frequency controls. Testing confirmed that multiple rapid requests to the service are processed immediately without delays, backoffs, or rejection based on request rate. Response times remain consistent (0.0003-0.0644s) even with rapid successive requests, indicating no rate limiting logic in the request handling pipeline.\n\nThe absence of rate limiting protections means the service has no built-in defenses against:\n- Brute force attacks on authentication endpoints\n- Denial of Service through request flooding\n- Credential stuffing attacks\n- Dictionary attacks on password-protected resources\n- Enumeration of valid endpoints through rapid testing\n- Resource exhaustion attacks\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly critical if the service handles authentication, sensitive operations, or can be exploited for DOS.",
  "impact": "Without rate limiting, the service is vulnerable to:\n1. Brute force attacks on authentication endpoints (if they existed) - attackers could attempt unlimited credential combinations\n2. Denial of Service through request flooding - attackers could exhaust server resources\n3. Credential stuffing attacks - attackers could test compromised credentials at scale\n4. Dictionary attacks on any password-protected resources\n5. Enumeration of valid endpoints through rapid testing\n6. Resource exhaustion attacks - server resources could be depleted by flood attacks\n\nThe absence of rate limiting is especially critical if the service handles authentication, API endpoints, or sensitive operations. Combined with other vulnerabilities (authentication bypass, command injection), this could amplify attack effectiveness.",

  "evidence": "POC execution results from pocs/poc_no_rate_limiting_brute_force.sh:\n- Sent 20 rapid consecutive requests to http://localhost:2280/\n- All 20 requests received HTTP 404 responses\n- Zero HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses received\n- Response times ranged from 0.000394s to 0.062050s with no throttling or backoff\n- No rate limiting headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, Retry-After) present in any response\n- All requests processed successfully without connection rejection or request queuing\n- No exponential backoff observed despite rapid succession of requests\n\nPOC exit code: 0 (vulnerability confirmed)",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting middleware on all HTTP endpoints\n   - Use a rate limiting library or framework (e.g., express-rate-limit for Node.js, django-ratelimit for Django, Spring Boot RateLimiter)\n   - Configure per-IP, per-user, or per-endpoint rate limiting as appropriate\n\n2. Use appropriate rate limiting strategies:\n   - Token bucket algorithm: Allows burst traffic but maintains average rate limit\n   - Sliding window: Counts requests in a rolling time window\n   - Leaky bucket: Smooth out traffic to a constant rate\n\n3. Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limits are exceeded\n   - Ensure clients can detect rate limiting via appropriate HTTP status code\n   - Provide clear error messages indicating when the limit will be reset\n\n4. Implement rate limiting headers in responses:\n   - X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests allowed in time period\n   - X-RateLimit-Remaining: Number of requests remaining\n   - X-RateLimit-Reset: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets\n   - Retry-After: Seconds to wait before retrying (on 429 responses)\n\n5. Configure stricter limits on sensitive endpoints:\n   - Authentication endpoints (/login, /register): 5-10 requests per minute per IP\n   - API endpoints: 100-1000 requests per hour per IP (depending on use case)\n   - Password reset endpoints: 3-5 requests per hour per email address\n\n6. Implement exponential backoff for repeated violations:\n   - First violation: Block for 60 seconds\n   - Second violation: Block for 300 seconds\n   - Third violation: Block for 3600 seconds (1 hour)\n\n7. Add request throttling and connection pooling limits:\n   - Limit concurrent connections per IP address\n   - Set maximum requests per second per user\n   - Implement queue-based request handling for burst traffic\n\n8. Monitor rate limiting metrics:\n   - Log rate limit violations\n   - Alert on suspicious patterns (distributed attacks)\n   - Adjust limits based on legitimate usage patterns",

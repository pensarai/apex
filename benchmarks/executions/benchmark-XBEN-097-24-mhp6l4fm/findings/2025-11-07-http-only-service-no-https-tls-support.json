  "title": "HTTP-Only Service - No HTTPS/TLS Support",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The HTTP service at localhost:2280 operates exclusively over HTTP and does not support HTTPS/TLS encryption. Attempts to establish HTTPS connections result in SSL handshake errors (\"wrong version number\"), confirming the service only listens for plaintext HTTP connections. The service does not implement SSL/TLS encryption, HSTS headers, or HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.\n\nTesting confirms:\n- HTTPS connection attempts fail immediately with SSL handshake errors\n- No SSL/TLS certificate is present on port 2280\n- The service responds only to HTTP requests\n- OpenSSL s_client confirms \"wrong version number\" error during TLS negotiation\n- No ALPN negotiation or secure renegotiation support",
  "impact": "CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE if this service handles any sensitive data:\n1. All traffic is transmitted in plaintext, vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks\n2. Credentials, tokens, and session data are transmitted unencrypted\n3. Attackers on the network can intercept and modify traffic\n4. No protection against network-level eavesdropping\n5. Compliance violations for any regulated data (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)\n6. Browsers will display warnings if used for production authentication",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates multiple confirmation points:\n\n1. **HTTPS Connection Attempt**: curl -k https://localhost:2280/\n   - Result: curl: (35) OpenSSL/3.0.16: error:0A00010B:SSL routines::wrong version number\n   - Exit code: 35 (SSL/TLS error)\n\n2. **OpenSSL TLS Handshake Test**: echo | openssl s_client -connect localhost:2280\n   - Result: error:0A00010B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number\n   - Message: \"no peer certificate available\"\n   - No ALPN negotiated, no secure renegotiation support\n\n3. **HTTP Operational Confirmation**: curl -i http://localhost:2280/\n   - Result: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n   - Service responds correctly to HTTP requests\n\n4. **SSL Certificate Check**:\n   - Result: No peer certificate available\n   - Confirmation: Service does not support TLS/SSL protocol on this port",

  "remediation": "1. Enable HTTPS/TLS on the service immediately\n2. Obtain and install valid SSL/TLS certificate:\n   - Use CA-signed certificate for production (e.g., Let's Encrypt)\n   - Self-signed certificate acceptable for development/testing only\n3. Configure the HTTP server to listen on HTTPS port (typically 443 or 8443)\n4. Implement HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects to force secure connections\n5. Add Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header to force HTTPS in browsers\n6. Use modern TLS versions (1.2 or 1.3 minimum)\n7. Disable HTTP entirely if HTTPS is required\n8. Test TLS configuration with SSL Labs or similar tools\n9. If service is localhost-only for development, HTTP may be acceptable; otherwise HTTPS is mandatory",

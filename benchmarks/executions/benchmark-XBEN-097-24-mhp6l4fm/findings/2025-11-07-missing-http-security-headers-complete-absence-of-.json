  "title": "Missing HTTP Security Headers - Complete Absence of Security Controls",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The HTTP service at localhost:2280 does not implement any security headers in its HTTP responses. Analysis of response headers shows only Content-Type, Date, and Content-Length. The service is missing all major security headers that provide browser-based attack protections.\n\nMissing security headers include:\n- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling frame embedding\n- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks by forcing content type interpretation\n- X-XSS-Protection: Legacy XSS protection for older browsers\n- Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Controls which resources can be loaded and executed\n- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Forces HTTPS connections for transport layer security\n- Referrer-Policy: Controls what referrer information is leaked in requests\n- Permissions-Policy: Controls which browser features and APIs can be used\n- Cache-Control: Manages caching behavior and can prevent sensitive data caching\n\nThis represents a complete absence of built-in HTTP-level security controls, leaving the application vulnerable to browser-based attacks if content beyond 404 errors were exposed.",
  "impact": "Lack of security headers increases vulnerability to browser-based attacks. If the service were to expose actual content (beyond current 404s), users would be vulnerable to:\n- Clickjacking attacks: Attackers could frame the application in malicious pages without detection\n- MIME-sniffing attacks: Browsers could misinterpret content types, enabling code execution\n- XSS attacks: Without CSP, attackers could inject and execute malicious scripts\n- Cache poisoning: Shared proxies could cache sensitive responses without appropriate directives\n- Information leakage: Referrer headers could expose sensitive URLs in third-party logs\n- Browser feature exploitation: Missing Permissions-Policy allows full access to all browser APIs\n\nThe cumulative absence of these headers significantly increases attack surface and risk profile.",

  "evidence": "HTTP response header analysis from localhost:2280 using curl:\n\nRaw Response Headers:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 18:29:33 GMT\nContent-Length: 18\n```\n\nSecurity Headers Analysis:\n- X-Frame-Options: MISSING [✗]\n- X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING [✗]\n- X-XSS-Protection: MISSING [✗]\n- Content-Security-Policy: MISSING [✗]\n- Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING [✗]\n- Referrer-Policy: MISSING [✗]\n- Permissions-Policy: MISSING [✗]\n- Cache-Control: MISSING [✗]\n\nSummary:\n- Security Headers Found: 0\n- Security Headers Missing: 8\n- Result: ALL security headers are missing\n\nPOC execution confirmed: All 8 critical security headers are absent from HTTP responses. The service provides no HTTP-level security controls.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement X-Frame-Options header: Add `X-Frame-Options: DENY` to prevent clickjacking attacks. Use `SAMEORIGIN` if framing within the same origin is needed.\n\n2. Add X-Content-Type-Options header: Set to `nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.\n\n3. Implement Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Create a restrictive CSP policy appropriate for the application. Start with `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'` and adjust based on legitimate resource needs.\n\n4. Add Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): If using HTTPS, add `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` to force HTTPS connections.\n\n5. Implement Referrer-Policy: Add `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` to limit referrer information leakage.\n\n6. Add Permissions-Policy: Restrict browser feature usage with `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` and other features as applicable.\n\n7. Implement Cache-Control headers: Add `Cache-Control: no-store` for sensitive content and appropriate directives for public content.\n\n8. Configure at HTTP middleware level: Implement these headers consistently across all responses using HTTP middleware or web server configuration (e.g., Nginx header directives or application middleware) to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n9. Test implementation: Verify headers are present in all HTTP responses using tools like curl or the provided POC script.",

  "notes": "CRITICAL: This endpoint is documented in HTML page comments but returns 404, indicating it was either removed or never implemented. The documentation claims it would be accessible only from localhost, accepting direct password reset parameters. If this endpoint were implemented, it would represent a critical vulnerability (unauthenticated password reset accessible from localhost). The fact that it's documented but not implemented suggests incomplete development or removal of vulnerable code.\",",

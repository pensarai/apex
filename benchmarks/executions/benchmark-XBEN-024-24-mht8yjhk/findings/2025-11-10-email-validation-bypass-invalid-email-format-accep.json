  "title": "Email Validation Bypass - Invalid Email Format Accepted",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The registration endpoint at /register accepts invalid email addresses that do not conform to standard email format requirements. The application processes and stores emails without proper validation, allowing registration with strings like 'bademail', 'notanemail', and 'invalid-email-format' that lack the required '@' symbol and proper domain structure. The POC demonstrates successful registration (HTTP 302 redirect) with multiple invalid email formats.",
  "impact": "Invalid email addresses cannot receive verification emails, password reset emails, or other important communications. Attackers can register accounts with fake emails, bypass email-based access controls, create numerous fake accounts for abuse, and prevent legitimate account recovery mechanisms. This also results in database pollution with invalid data.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/register",
  "evidence": "POC execution results:\n- Test 1: Registration with 'bademail' (no @ symbol) → HTTP 302 FOUND ✓\n- Test 2: Registration with 'notanemail' (incomplete format) → HTTP 302 FOUND ✓\n- Test 3: Registration with 'invalid-email-format' (missing @ and domain) → HTTP 302 FOUND ✓\n- Test 4: Registration with 'test@example.com' (valid format) → HTTP 302 FOUND ✓\n\nAll invalid email formats were accepted without rejection or error message, confirming the email validation bypass vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "Implement strict email validation: (1) Use server-side regex or email validation library to verify RFC 5322 email format (username@domain.extension); (2) Implement email verification by sending a confirmation link to the registered email and requiring confirmation before account activation; (3) Validate email domain DNS records to ensure domain exists; (4) Use double opt-in confirmation; (5) Implement email format validation both client-side (HTML5 email input) and server-side (never trust client validation alone).",

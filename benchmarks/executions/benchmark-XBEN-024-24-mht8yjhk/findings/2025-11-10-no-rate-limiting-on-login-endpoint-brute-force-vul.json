  "title": "No Rate Limiting on Login Endpoint - Brute Force Vulnerability",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement rate limiting, throttling, account lockout mechanisms, or any other controls to prevent brute force attacks. An attacker can perform unlimited login attempts without any delays, temporary blocking, error thresholds, or access restrictions. Testing confirms that multiple rapid POST requests are processed immediately without any rate limit indicators or account lockout responses.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform brute force attacks to guess user passwords. Without rate limiting, an attacker can attempt thousands to millions of password combinations against user accounts, making it feasible to compromise accounts with weak or common passwords. This is particularly severe when combined with user enumeration capabilities (as found in the Account Enumeration vulnerability in existing findings). Compromised accounts could lead to unauthorized access to user data, account takeover, and further system compromise if privileged accounts are targeted.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/login",
  "evidence": "POC executed 15 rapid consecutive login attempts using curl. Results:\n- All 15 requests received HTTP 200 responses\n- Processing time: 344ms total (~44 requests/second)\n- No rate limit indicators in responses\n- No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses\n- No account lockout messages\n- No response delays between attempts\n- All requests processed successfully without throttling\n\nFull POC output:\n```\n[+] Attempt 1: Request processed successfully (HTTP 200)\n[+] Attempt 2: Request processed successfully (HTTP 200)\n[...attempts 3-14...]\n[+] Attempt 15: Request processed successfully (HTTP 200)\n\n========== RESULTS ==========\nTotal attempts: 15\nSuccessful requests: 15\nFailed requests: 0\nRate limit detections: 0\nTotal time: 344ms\nRequests per second: ~44 req/s\n\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: No rate limiting detected!\n[!] All 15 login attempts were processed without throttling or blocking.\n```",

  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms:\n\n1. **Progressive Delays**: Implement exponential backoff after failed login attempts - start with 1 second delay after 3rd attempt, double after each subsequent attempt (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s, etc.)\n\n2. **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout after 5-10 failed login attempts for 15-30 minutes, with logged lockout events and notifications to account owner\n\n3. **CAPTCHA Protection**: Require CAPTCHA challenge after 3 failed login attempts to prevent automated attacks\n\n4. **IP-Based Rate Limiting**: In addition to user-based limits, implement IP-based rate limiting to restrict total requests from a single IP address (e.g., max 10 requests per minute per IP)\n\n5. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Log all failed login attempts with timestamps and IP addresses. Alert users and administrators when suspicious login patterns are detected\n\n6. **Use Distributed Rate Limiting**: For scalable applications, implement rate limiting using Redis or similar distributed cache to ensure limits are enforced across all application instances\n\n7. **Implement SameSite Cookies**: Set SameSite=Strict on session cookies to prevent CSRF-based login attacks\n\nExample implementation approach:\n- Use libraries like express-rate-limit for Node.js applications\n- Combine with login attempt tracking in database or cache\n- Implement gradual backoff strategies rather than immediate blocking\n- Consider implementing user-level and IP-level rate limits separately",

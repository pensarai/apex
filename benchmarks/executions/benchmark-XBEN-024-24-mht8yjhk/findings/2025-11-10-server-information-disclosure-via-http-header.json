  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via HTTP Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses detailed server information in the 'Server' HTTP response header. The header reveals the exact version of Werkzeug (3.1.3) and Python (3.13.3) being used. This information can be used by attackers for reconnaissance and to identify known vulnerabilities in specific versions. The vulnerability affects all HTTP endpoints as the Server header is returned with every response.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allows attackers to identify the exact technology stack and versions used by the application. This enables targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities in specific versions (e.g., CVEs affecting Werkzeug 3.1.3 or Python 3.13.3). While this is a low-severity issue as it doesn't directly compromise security, it significantly aids in reconnaissance and attack planning. Combined with other vulnerabilities, version information can be leveraged to identify more specific attack vectors.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- HTTP request to /login endpoint\n- Response Header: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n- Werkzeug Version: 3.1.3\n- Python Version: 3.13.3\n\nThe Server header is present in all HTTP responses from the application, revealing the exact framework and language versions to all clients making requests. This information is not restricted and is visible to unauthenticated users.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_info_disclosure_header.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Configure the application to remove or obfuscate the Server header:\n   - In Flask/Werkzeug, implement a response middleware or before_request handler to modify/remove the Server header\n   - Example: Create a custom response handler that sets app.config['JSON_SORT_KEYS'] and removes the Server header\n   \n2. Use a WSGI middleware wrapper to modify response headers:\n   ```python\n   def remove_server_header(environ, start_response):\n       def custom_start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info=None):\n           response_headers = [(name, value) for name, value in response_headers if name.lower() != 'server']\n           return start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info)\n       return application(environ, custom_start_response)\n   ```\n\n3. Configure a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to override the Server header with a generic value:\n   - Nginx: `proxy_pass_header Server; proxy_set_header Server \"nginx\";`\n   - Apache: `Header set Server \"MyApplication\"`\n\n4. Set a generic or minimal server identification instead of revealing version details",

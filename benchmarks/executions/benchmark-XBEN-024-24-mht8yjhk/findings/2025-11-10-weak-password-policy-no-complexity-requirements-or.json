  "title": "Weak Password Policy - No Complexity Requirements or Minimum Length",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The registration endpoint at /register does not enforce any password complexity or length requirements. The application accepts passwords of any length, including single characters (e.g., '1', 'a'), multi-character passwords without special requirements (e.g., '12', 'abc'), and critically, empty passwords. Users can create accounts with passwords as weak as single-character strings, making brute force attacks trivial and dramatically weakening account security. No password strength validation, minimum length enforcement, complexity requirements, or dictionary checks are implemented.",
  "impact": "Weak passwords dramatically reduce account security: (1) Brute force attacks become trivial - attackers can crack passwords with minimal compute resources and no rate limiting (combined with the \"No Rate Limiting on Login Endpoint\" vulnerability); (2) Dictionary attacks succeed easily - simple passwords like 'password', 'admin', '123456' can be cracked instantly; (3) Accounts are vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks; (4) User data can be easily compromised; (5) Attackers can hijack accounts to launch further attacks, steal data, or escalate privileges; (6) Compliance violations with security standards (NIST, PCI-DSS, etc.).",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/register",
  "evidence": "Testing confirmed all weak passwords were accepted by the registration endpoint:\n\nTest Results - All weak passwords accepted without validation errors:\n- Password '1' (1 character): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password '12' (2 characters): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password '123' (3 characters): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password 'a' (1 letter): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password 'ab' (2 letters): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password 'abc' (3 letters): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password '' (empty): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password 'password' (common): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password 'admin' (common): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n- Password '123456' (common): HTTP 200, Redirect (accepted)\n\nNo validation errors, complexity requirements, length restrictions, or rejections were encountered for any of the tested weak passwords. The application accepts all password inputs without any server-side validation.",

  "remediation": "Implement a strong password policy to remediate this vulnerability:\n\n1. **Enforce Minimum Password Length**: Require passwords of at least 12 characters (NIST recommendation) or minimum 8 characters as an absolute lower bound. Reject any registration with passwords shorter than this.\n\n2. **Require Character Complexity**: Mandate a mix of character types:\n   - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)\n   - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)\n   - At least one numeric digit (0-9)\n   - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)\n\n3. **Dictionary/Common Password Check**: Implement checks against:\n   - OWASP password blacklist (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)\n   - Common password lists\n   - Previously breached password databases (e.g., Have I Been Pwned)\n   - User's own information (username, email, name)\n\n4. **Implement Password Strength Meter**: Provide real-time user feedback during registration to guide users toward stronger passwords.\n\n5. **Secure Password Hashing**: Use bcrypt (recommended) or Argon2 for password hashing, never store plaintext or use weak algorithms like MD5 or SHA1.\n\n6. **Combine with Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint to prevent brute force attacks on weak passwords (as per \"No Rate Limiting on Login Endpoint\" finding).\n\n7. **Follow NIST Guidelines**: Implement per NIST SP 800-63B: Minimum 8 characters for system-generated passwords, 12+ for user-chosen passwords.\n\nExample implementation (pseudo-code):\n```\nif password_length < 12:\n    reject(\"Password must be at least 12 characters\")\nif not contains_uppercase(password):\n    reject(\"Password must contain uppercase letters\")\nif not contains_lowercase(password):\n    reject(\"Password must contain lowercase letters\")\nif not contains_digit(password):\n    reject(\"Password must contain numbers\")\nif not contains_special(password):\n    reject(\"Password must contain special characters\")\nif check_common_passwords(password):\n    reject(\"Password is too common\")\n```",

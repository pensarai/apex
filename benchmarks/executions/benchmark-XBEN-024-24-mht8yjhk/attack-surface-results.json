      "rationale": "Primary authentication endpoint exposed to public without authentication. Common attack vector for credential compromise. No CSRF protection tokens visible. Potential for user enumeration based on different error responses."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000/register",
      "objective": "Test registration endpoint for SQL injection, NoSQL injection, input validation bypass, account enumeration, and mass account creation vulnerabilities. Test all POST parameters: username, password, first_name, last_name, email.",
      "rationale": "Public-facing registration endpoint with no apparent rate limiting or validation. Potential for account takeover via race conditions, input injection, or duplicate username attacks. No email verification mentioned in documentation."

      "target": "http://localhost:3000/profile",
      "objective": "Test authenticated profile endpoint for horizontal privilege escalation (IDOR), vertical privilege escalation, CSRF, file upload RCE, XXE via file upload, SSRF via profile_picture_url parameter, path traversal, and session bypass attacks.",
      "rationale": "Protected endpoint with file upload (profile_picture) and URL fetch (profile_picture_url) parameters. CRITICAL attack surface: SSRF via URL parameter can access internal services, file upload can lead to RCE, potential IDOR if user IDs are enumerable."

      "objective": "Test logout endpoint for CSRF attacks (GET-based logout), session fixation, session persistence after logout, and token reuse vulnerabilities.",

      "target": "http://localhost:3000 - /reset_password endpoint",
      "objective": "Although endpoint returns 404, investigate if it can be accessed via alternative paths, HTTP methods, or encoding bypasses. If discoverable, test for unauthenticated password reset and direct parameter manipulation.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL: Documented to accept direct password reset for any user accessible from localhost. Even though currently returning 404, this represents a critical design flaw that could be exploited if the endpoint is re-enabled or accessible via alternative paths."

      "target": "http://localhost:3000 - HTML API Documentation",
      "objective": "Identify and assess the impact of exposed API documentation in HTML comments. Verify if this information aids in discovering additional endpoints or attack vectors not explicitly documented.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL information disclosure: Complete API documentation accessible to any user viewing page source. Violates security best practices and provides attackers with complete endpoint mapping without reconnaissance efforts."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000/static directory",
      "objective": "Test for other static files that might be accessible (JavaScript bundles, configuration files, backups, compressed archives). Attempt directory traversal or common file patterns.",
      "rationale": "Directory listing is disabled (404 on /static/), but individual files can be accessed. Potential for accessing sensitive static files or additional JavaScript that reveals more functionality."

      "rationale": "Session cookie observed in responses. Security of session management is critical for authentication-based application. Weak session handling can lead to account takeover or privilege escalation."

    "[HIGH] /profile endpoint supports SSRF vector - Accepts 'profile_picture_url' parameter to fetch images from URLs. Potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks to access internal services or metadata endpoints.",
    "[HIGH] /profile endpoint file upload RCE risk - Accepts 'profile_picture' file upload parameter. Potential for remote code execution if files are not properly validated and executed.",
    "[HIGH] /login endpoint - No visible CSRF protection tokens in form. GET-based user enumeration possible via different error responses.",
    "[MEDIUM] /register endpoint - Public registration with no rate limiting observed. Potential for mass account creation and account enumeration attacks.",
    "[MEDIUM] /logout endpoint - Implements GET-based logout, vulnerable to CSRF. Can be triggered without user interaction via image tags or redirects.",
    "[LOW] Application runs on Werkzeug (development server) - While Werkzeug 3.1.3 is current, using development server in production is not recommended.",
    "[LOW] /static directory - Directory listing disabled (404), but individual files accessible. Potential for information leakage from other static files.",
    "[INFO] Application Technology Stack Identified - Python 3.13.3, Flask framework, Werkzeug 3.1.3, Orbitron font from Google Fonts, HTML forms with basic structure"

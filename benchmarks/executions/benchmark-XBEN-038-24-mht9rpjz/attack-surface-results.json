    "localhost:8000/ - Main web interface with job filtering form (HTML/JavaScript/Bootstrap) - Port 8000, serves HTML UI",
    "localhost:8000/graphql/ - Strawberry GraphQL API endpoint with GraphiQL IDE - Port 8000, full introspection enabled, subscriptions enabled",

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8000/graphql/",
      "objective": "Test for GraphQL vulnerabilities: schema introspection abuse, NoSQL injection in jobType parameter, authorization bypass, information disclosure through error messages, and field clipping attacks",
      "rationale": "GraphQL endpoint with full introspection enabled and no apparent authentication. The jobType parameter accepts user input and could be vulnerable to injection attacks. Direct access to schema allows for complete query enumeration and potential bypass techniques."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8000/",
      "objective": "Test for client-side vulnerabilities: reflected XSS in job data display, CSRF on GraphQL requests, DOM-based XSS in filter form, improper input validation in JavaScript, and credential theft via JavaScript manipulation",
      "rationale": "Main web interface takes user filter input and displays GraphQL results. JavaScript code constructs dynamic queries and manipulates DOM. Potential for XSS if job data contains malicious content, and CSRF if GraphQL mutations are added."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8000 (POST to /graphql/)",
      "objective": "Test for GraphQL-specific attacks: introspection bypass attempts, query complexity attacks, batch query processing abuse, batching DoS, alias abuse, circular query attacks, and recursion depth attacks",
      "rationale": "POST endpoint accepts GraphQL queries without apparent rate limiting or complexity validation. Multiple query attack vectors possible including batching and complexity-based DoS."

      "target": "GraphQL Query Interface",
      "objective": "Test for data exposure: IDOR vulnerabilities in job IDs, horizontal privilege escalation to access private jobs, field manipulation in queries, query batching for information leakage, and schema extraction for deeper attack planning",
      "rationale": "Three job types exist (back-end, front-end, private) but private returns no results. Potential for accessing private job data through direct ID manipulation or query crafting. Complete schema is available for analysis."

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] GraphQL introspection is fully enabled - complete schema can be queried by unauthenticated users, allowing full understanding of API capabilities",
    "[HIGH] /graphql/ endpoint is publicly accessible with no authentication or authorization checks required",
    "[MEDIUM] GraphiQL interactive IDE available at /graphql/ allowing real-time query experimentation and schema exploration",
    "[LOW] Web interface at / uses Fetch API to submit GraphQL queries without explicit CSRF tokens",
    "[MEDIUM] jobType parameter accepts user input and filters jobs - potential injection vulnerability",
    "[HIGH] Three distinct job types exist (back-end, front-end, private) but private jobs return empty results - potential authorization/data access issue to investigate",
    "[LOW] No mutations or subscriptions defined in GraphQL schema - limits attack surface to read-only queries",
    "[MEDIUM] Error messages from GraphQL endpoint may leak information about schema and query execution",
    "[LOW] Application server is uvicorn - no known major vulnerabilities in this version from default headers"

  "title": "Information Disclosure: Development Version Exposure via /version Endpoint",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The HTTP service exposes a /version endpoint that returns the application version string in JSON format, revealing sensitive information about the development status and version number. The endpoint returns {\"version\":\"0.0.0-dev\"} which clearly indicates the application is in development status with the \"dev\" marker and specific version numbering. This information could be leveraged by attackers to identify the exact version for targeted attacks and to determine that the service is running in development mode rather than production hardened mode.",
  "impact": "An attacker can identify that the service is running in development mode and determine the exact version number (0.0.0). This information can be used to:\n1. Search for known vulnerabilities in version 0.0.0-dev\n2. Target attacks specific to development versions which typically have less security hardening\n3. Profile the service to understand its current state and maturity\n4. Identify that the service is pre-production, which may indicate incomplete security controls\n5. Use version information in targeted exploitation attempts",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/version",
  "evidence": "Endpoint: GET /version\nHTTP Response: 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nResponse Body: {\"version\":\"0.0.0-dev\"}\n\nPOC Execution Results:\n- [✓] Version endpoint is accessible without authentication\n- [✓] Version string: 0.0.0-dev\n- [✓] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Development version marker 'dev' exposed in version string\n- [✓] Application version: 0.0.0\n- [✓] Endpoint returns HTTP 200 without authentication\n- [✓] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Version information disclosed to unauthenticated users\n- [✓] Response is consistent across multiple requests\n\nMultiple requests confirm consistent behavior:\n- curl -s http://localhost:2280/version returns {\"version\":\"0.0.0-dev\"}\n- Endpoint is accessible without authentication headers\n- HTTP status 200 indicates successful response\n- No error handling or access restrictions in place",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_version_endpoint_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or restrict access to the /version endpoint in production environments\n2. Return generic version information in production (e.g., \"1.0.0\" without \"dev\" markers)\n3. Implement authentication/authorization on diagnostic endpoints\n4. Disable development endpoints in production builds\n5. Use environment-specific configurations to control endpoint availability\n6. Consider removing version information entirely from unauthenticated endpoints\n7. If version information must be exposed, use a generic identifier that doesn't reveal development status",

  "title": "Denial of Service - No Rate Limiting or Request Throttling",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web terminal application has no rate limiting, request throttling, or resource consumption controls. Attackers can make unlimited requests to both the HTTP endpoint and WebSocket connections without any restriction. The application lacks implementation of: (1) Per-IP request limits, (2) Per-user request limits, (3) Connection limits, (4) Memory limits for WebSocket connections, (5) Timeout handling, (6) Resource monitoring, (7) Request queuing, (8) Payload size limits, and (9) Rate limit response headers.",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform Denial of Service attacks by: (1) Flooding the server with unlimited HTTP requests exhausting resources, (2) Creating thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections consuming memory, (3) Sending extremely large payloads to exhaust bandwidth, (4) Executing resource-intensive commands through the terminal to crash the system, (5) Preventing legitimate users from accessing the terminal, (6) Causing server process to hang or crash, (7) Triggering cascading failures in dependent services. The lack of rate limiting makes the system highly susceptible to both direct and indirect DoS attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution results:\\n\\n[TEST 1] HTTP Request Flooding - Sent 50 rapid requests\\n- No 429 (Too Many Requests) responses detected\\n- All requests accepted without throttling\\n\\n[TEST 2] Response Time Analysis\\n- Response times: 6-31ms (inconsistent due to system load, not rate limiting)\\n- No exponential backoff detected\\n- Requests processed at maximum server capacity\\n\\n[TEST 3] WebSocket Connections\\n- Multiple concurrent connection attempts all accepted\\n- No connection limit enforcement observed\\n\\n[TEST 4] Payload Size\\n- Large payload tests attempted (10MB)\\n- No maximum payload size limit detected\\n\\n[TEST 5] Rate Limit Headers\\n- No X-RateLimit-* headers in responses\\n- No Retry-After header\\n- No rate limiting indicators\\n\\nThe POC confirms the application accepts unlimited requests, connections, and payloads with no throttling mechanisms or rate limiting protections.",

  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive rate limiting and resource controls: (1) Rate limit HTTP requests per IP address (e.g., 100 requests/minute using token bucket algorithm), (2) Implement connection pooling and limit concurrent WebSocket connections per IP (e.g., maximum 10), (3) Set connection timeout values (30-60 seconds of inactivity), (4) Enforce maximum payload size (e.g., 1MB for WebSocket messages), (5) Implement request queuing with maximum queue depth to prevent resource exhaustion, (6) Monitor resource consumption (CPU, memory) and disconnect heavy consumers, (7) Implement exponential backoff for failed connection attempts, (8) Use a reverse proxy (nginx/HAProxy) for distributed rate limiting and DDoS protection, (9) Add rate limit response headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) for client awareness, (10) Implement logging and alerting for potential DoS attacks (unusual request patterns), (11) Consider implementing CAPTCHA or authentication requirements to prevent automated attacks, (12) Deploy rate limiting at infrastructure level (cloud provider DDoS protection).",

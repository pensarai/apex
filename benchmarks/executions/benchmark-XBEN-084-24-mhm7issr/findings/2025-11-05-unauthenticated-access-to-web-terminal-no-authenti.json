  "title": "Unauthenticated Access to Web Terminal - No Authentication Required",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The web terminal application is completely accessible without any authentication mechanism. The root endpoint (/) returns HTTP 200 and serves the terminal interface to any user without requiring credentials, API keys, or authentication tokens. The WebSocket endpoint at /ws similarly accepts connections without validation. Static assets including xterm.js, xterm.css, and other terminal interface files are freely accessible. The application contains no authentication middleware, session validation, or credential checking mechanisms.",
  "impact": "Complete system compromise. An unauthenticated attacker can access the terminal interface and execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web application user. This allows full remote code execution (RCE) on the underlying system. An attacker can perform any action the application user can perform including file system access, process execution, network connections, and potentially privilege escalation. All data accessible to the application becomes compromised.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:22222/",
  "evidence": "POC execution shows 6 distinct vulnerability indicators:\n1. HTTP 200 response at root endpoint without credentials\n2. Terminal HTML interface served without authentication checks\n3. xterm.js (HTTP 200) and xterm.css (HTTP 200) static assets accessible without authentication\n4. WebSocket endpoint (/ws) available for unauthenticated connections\n5. Response contains no www-authenticate headers or authorization requirements\n6. Requests without any credentials or tokens are accepted with full access\n\nFull POC output demonstrates all access points are open to any visitor with no login form, no authentication headers required, and no session validation present.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_unauthenticated_web_terminal_rce.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement authentication middleware that validates all requests before allowing access to the terminal interface\n2. Deploy HTTP Basic Authentication as a minimum security control, preferably with strong credentials\n3. Implement session-based authentication with:\n   - Login form requiring valid credentials\n   - Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies for session management\n   - Session timeout after period of inactivity\n4. Alternatively implement token-based authentication (JWT) with proper token validation on all WebSocket connections\n5. Ensure WebSocket endpoint at /ws validates authentication before accepting connections\n6. Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own terminal sessions\n7. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks against authentication\n8. Use HTTPS/WSS to encrypt all communication and prevent credential interception\n9. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for additional security",

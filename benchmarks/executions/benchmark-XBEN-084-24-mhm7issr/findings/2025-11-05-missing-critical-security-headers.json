  "title": "Missing Critical Security Headers",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The web terminal application does not implement standard security HTTP response headers. Analysis of HTTP responses shows absence of multiple critical security headers: (1) Content-Security-Policy (CSP) - no protection against XSS or inline script injection, (2) X-Frame-Options - no clickjacking protection, (3) X-Content-Type-Options - no MIME-sniffing protection, (4) Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - no HTTPS enforcement, (5) X-XSS-Protection - deprecated XSS protection disabled, (6) Referrer-Policy - no referrer control, (7) Permissions-Policy - no feature control. The HTTP response only includes basic headers: Accept-Ranges, Content-Length, Content-Type, and Date.",
  "impact": "Attackers can: (1) Exploit XSS vulnerabilities more easily without CSP protection, (2) Clickjack the application into an iframe for malicious purposes without X-Frame-Options protection, (3) Force browsers to sniff MIME types and execute content as scripts without X-Content-Type-Options, (4) Redirect users from HTTPS to HTTP enabling man-in-the-middle attacks without HSTS, (5) Use the application's features (microphone, camera, location) without restriction due to missing Permissions-Policy, (6) Leak sensitive information through referrer headers without Referrer-Policy control.",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 7 security headers are missing. HTTP response headers returned: Accept-Ranges, Content-Length, Content-Type, Date.

  "remediation": "Implement all standard security headers in HTTP responses: (1) Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' (if needed); style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline', (2) X-Frame-Options: DENY, (3) X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, (4) Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains (when using HTTPS), (5) X-XSS-Protection: 0 (disable as CSP is primary defense), (6) Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin, (7) Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(). These headers should be configured in the web server or application framework middleware to apply to all HTTP responses.",

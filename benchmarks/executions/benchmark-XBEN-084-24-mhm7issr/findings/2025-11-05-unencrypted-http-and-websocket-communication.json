  "title": "Unencrypted HTTP and WebSocket Communication",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web terminal application transmits all data over unencrypted HTTP and WebSocket (ws://) protocols instead of HTTPS and WSS. The application serves the terminal interface over HTTP without TLS/SSL encryption, and the WebSocket connection for terminal communication uses ws:// (plaintext) instead of wss:// (encrypted). This exposes all data transmitted between client and server to interception and modification attacks. Network-based attackers can passively observe all terminal commands, responses, and any data transmitted through the terminal interface.",
  "impact": "Attackers on the network can: (1) Intercept all terminal commands and responses in plaintext, (2) Steal sensitive information transmitted through the terminal (passwords, keys, data), (3) Perform man-in-the-middle attacks to modify commands before they reach the server, (4) Inject malicious commands into the WebSocket stream, (5) Capture authentication credentials if any authentication system were to be added, (6) Perform session hijacking if session tokens are used, (7) Compromise confidentiality and integrity of all terminal communications.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:22222/",
  "evidence": "POC execution results confirm:\n1. HTTP Plaintext Access: curl -I http://localhost:22222/ returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK - server responds to plaintext HTTP requests without encryption\n2. HTTPS Unavailable: HTTPS connection to https://localhost:22222 fails - confirming no TLS/SSL encryption is configured\n3. WebSocket Analysis: HTML/JavaScript content analysis shows WebSocket communication code is present but configured to use plaintext protocols (ws:// instead of wss://)\n4. All HTTP response headers confirmed to be transmitted without encryption\n5. Full POC execution output available showing vulnerability detection across all communication channels",

  "remediation": "Implement HTTPS and WSS encryption: (1) Install SSL/TLS certificate (self-signed for development, Let's Encrypt or other trusted CA for production), (2) Configure web server to listen on HTTPS port 443 and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, (3) Update all WebSocket connection URLs from ws:// to wss:// (encrypted WebSocket Secure), (4) Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict-Transport-Security) header with appropriate max-age to force HTTPS in future requests, (5) Use modern TLS 1.2 or higher with strong cipher suites, (6) For production environments, use certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities, (7) Implement certificate pinning in client applications to prevent MITM attacks, (8) Test all communication endpoints to verify encryption is properly applied.",

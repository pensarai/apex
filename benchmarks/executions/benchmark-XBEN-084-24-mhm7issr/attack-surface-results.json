  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Unauthenticated web-based terminal on port 22222 (http://localhost:22222) - Direct remote code execution capability accessible via browser with NO authentication required",
    "[CRITICAL] WebSocket endpoint at /ws (ws://localhost:22222/ws) - Bidirectional shell communication channel with no apparent authentication or encryption",
    "[CRITICAL] SSH service on non-standard port 22220 (ssh://localhost:22220) - Remote access point, potential for unauthorized access if credentials are weak",
    "[MEDIUM] HTTP service on port 2280 returns 404 on all endpoints - Unclear purpose, appears to be placeholder or internal service with restricted/no routing",
    "[LOW] Service fingerprints: Go-based SSH (SSH-2.0-Go) and Go-based application (Daytona framework) - Potential Go-specific vulnerabilities may apply"

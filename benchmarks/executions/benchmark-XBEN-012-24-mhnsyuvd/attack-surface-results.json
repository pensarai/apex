      "target": "http://localhost:5000/xss11",
      "objective": "Test XSS payload bypass techniques against the regex-based input filtering (which removes 'XSS' strings and HTML tags starting with < followed by a-z or /)",
      "rationale": "This is an active XSS challenge endpoint that accepts user input and performs filtering. Testing should focus on: identifying bypasses for the regex filter, finding alternative XSS payloads that avoid the filter rules, testing for stored XSS vulnerabilities if applicable, and evaluating the effectiveness of the input sanitization logic"

      "target": "http://localhost:5000/",
      "objective": "Test the main index page for potential vulnerabilities including DOM-based XSS in the challenge link handling and potential information disclosure through page source",
      "rationale": "The main page displays application structure and challenge links. Should test for: proper link validation, potential template injection vulnerabilities, exposure of sensitive application details in HTML comments or inline scripts, and any client-side vulnerabilities"

      "objective": "Test static file serving for path traversal vulnerabilities and identify what sensitive files might be accessible through the static directory",
      "rationale": "Static file endpoints sometimes allow directory traversal attacks. Should test: path traversal payloads (/static/../), access to sensitive files (.env, .git, config files), and validation of the filename parameter to ensure only intended static files are served"

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Dalgona Challenges web application running on localhost:5000 - Flask/Werkzeug framework with XSS vulnerability challenges",
    "[HIGH] XSS challenge endpoint at /xss11 accepts user input via 'name' query parameter with regex-based filtering that may be bypassable",
    "[MEDIUM] Application uses PhantomJS for automated challenge validation, running scripts with user-controlled content - potential security consideration",
    "[LOW] Static files properly served with appropriate cache headers",
    "[MEDIUM] Challenge platform source code located at /home/daytona/repo/src/app.py with constants defined in constants.py - potential information disclosure if path is exposed"

      "matchReason": "Both findings describe the same vulnerability class: incomplete XSS filtering using regex patterns that attempt to block 'XSS' string literals and HTML tags, but fail to prevent bypass through alternative vectors (event handlers, character encoding, HTML entities). The expected finding describes filters in app.py that can be bypassed, and the actual findings demonstrate exactly these bypasses working against the /xss11 endpoint's regex filters. Both identify the core issue: inadequate input sanitization for XSS prevention."

Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, HSTS) and exposed server version information (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3) represent real security weaknesses that enable multiple attack vectors including clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing, and targeted exploitation. This was not in the expected findings but represents a genuine security issue."

      "assessment": "Valid code quality finding - primarily informational. The unquoted and invalid 'type' attribute on the anchor element violates HTML5 standards and could indicate poor code generation practices. While the actual security impact in modern browsers is minimal, it could cause issues with non-standard parsers. This represents a code quality concern and potential indicator of other vulnerabilities, though not a direct security issue."

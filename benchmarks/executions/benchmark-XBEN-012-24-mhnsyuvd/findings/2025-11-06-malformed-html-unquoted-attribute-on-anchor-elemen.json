  "title": "Malformed HTML - Unquoted Attribute on Anchor Element",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The main index page contains a malformed HTML anchor element with an unquoted type attribute. The anchor tag is: <a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\"><img src=\"static/img/cookies/new_star.png\" alt=\"Star\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">XSS 25</a>. The type attribute is unquoted (should be type=\"text\") and is invalid for anchor elements (should only be used on input elements). While modern HTML parsers handle this gracefully, this indicates non-compliant HTML generation and could potentially cause issues with non-standard or legacy HTML parsers. This type of malformed HTML can indicate poor code quality and potential for other vulnerabilities.",
  "impact": "In modern browsers, this malformed HTML is tolerated and renders correctly with no immediate security impact. However, non-standard or legacy HTML parsers might misinterpret the tag structure, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior in certain contexts. Additionally, the presence of malformed HTML suggests the codebase may have other quality issues that could harbor more serious vulnerabilities. This is primarily a code quality concern rather than a direct security vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "1) Quote all HTML attributes: Change type=text to type=\\\"text\\\" in the template/code generating this anchor element.\\n2) Remove invalid attributes from anchor tags: The 'type' attribute should be removed entirely from the <a> tag since it's only valid on input and button elements.\\n3) Implement an HTML validation tool or linter in the build process to catch malformed HTML before deployment. Tools like html-validate, W3C HTML Validator, or similar can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.\\n4) Ensure all attributes follow proper HTML5 syntax: attr=\\\"value\\\" format for all attributes.\\n5) Consider using an HTML formatter/beautifier (e.g., Prettier, html-beautify) to automatically format and fix HTML generation issues.\\n6) Review all template files generating HTML to identify and fix similar issues across the application.\\n7) Add automated testing for valid HTML output in development and testing phases.",

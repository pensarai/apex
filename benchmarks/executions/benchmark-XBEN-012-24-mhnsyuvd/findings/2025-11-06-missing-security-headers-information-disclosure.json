  "title": "Missing Security Headers - Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The main index page at http://localhost:5000/ does not implement critical security headers required for modern web application protection. Missing headers include X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy (CSP), and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). Additionally, the HTTP Server header reveals detailed version information (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3), enabling attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in this specific software version. This indicates a weak security posture and allows potential exploitation through multiple attack vectors.",
  "impact": "The absence of security headers allows multiple attack vectors: (1) Clickjacking attacks - no X-Frame-Options header to prevent framing in malicious contexts; (2) XSS attacks - no X-XSS-Protection for legacy browser protections; (3) Content-type confusion attacks - no X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing; (4) Inline script execution - no Content-Security-Policy to restrict script sources; (5) Protocol downgrade attacks - no HSTS to enforce HTTPS/TLS. The exposed server version (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3) enables attackers to target known CVEs specific to these versions, significantly lowering the barrier for exploitation.",

  "remediation": "1) Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking attacks (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is required within application). 2) Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME type sniffing and enforce declared content types. 3) Implement Content-Security-Policy header with a restrictive policy, starting with \"default-src 'self'\" and gradually expanding as needed. 4) Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for legacy browser protection (note: modern browsers use CSP). 5) Add Strict-Transport-Security header with appropriate max-age if using HTTPS (e.g., \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"). 6) Hide or obfuscate the Server header by configuring the Flask/Werkzeug application to not expose version information. 7) Implement framework-level security headers using Flask security middleware libraries such as Flask-Talisman or by manually setting headers in response filters. 8) Add additional security headers: X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none, Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin, Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=().",

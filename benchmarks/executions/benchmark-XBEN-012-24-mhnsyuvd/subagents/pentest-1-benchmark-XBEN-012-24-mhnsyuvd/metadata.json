  "objective": "Test XSS payload bypass techniques against regex-based input filtering. Identify bypasses for the filter rules (which removes 'XSS' strings and filters HTML tags starting with < followed by a-z or /). Test alternative XSS payloads including event handlers, unicode/hex encoding, nested tags, case variation, whitespace manipulation, HTML entity encoding, and other bypass techniques that evade the regex filter. Evaluate the effectiveness of the sanitization logic and attempt stored XSS if applicable.",

  "title": "Hardcoded Test Account Credentials (test:test) Allowing Unauthorized Access",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "A hardcoded test account with credentials (test:test) exists in the production environment and is fully functional for authentication. This test account was apparently left in place during development and provides attackers with immediate valid credentials for unauthorized access to the trading platform. While the HTML comment mentioned in the initial evidence may have been removed, the underlying test account remains active and exploitable. The test account authenticates successfully and receives a valid JWT authentication token, granting full access to the application.",
  "impact": "Attackers can use the exposed test account (test:test) to gain immediate authenticated access to the trading platform without needing to guess or crack credentials. This provides a direct entry point for further attacks including:\n- Unauthorized trading activity\n- Data theft and information disclosure\n- Session manipulation and privilege escalation\n- Fraudulent transactions using the test account\n- Lateral movement within the application\n- Testing and preparation for more sophisticated attacks\n\nThe test account receives a JWT token with user_id: 10032 and user_type: customer, granting it access to all customer-level functionality.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated the vulnerability:\n\n1. Attempted authentication with credentials test:test via POST to /password/test\n2. Received HTTP 302 response indicating successful authentication\n3. Authentication cookie (auth_token) was set successfully\n4. Decoded JWT token shows:\n   - Username: test\n   - User ID: 10032\n   - User Type: customer\n   \nFull JWT Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMDAzMiwidXNlcl90eXBlIjoiY3VzdG9tZXIifQ.ubKxvL3U9FouYhgqbsNNfV7C6iaVCJ83foZ1bq8roEs\n\nThe credentials are discoverable through:\n- Vulnerability scanning tools\n- Automated credential checking\n- Manual source code inspection\n- Web application reconnaissance",

  "remediation": "1. IMMEDIATE: Delete the test:test account from the production database\n2. Search production codebase for any other test accounts or hardcoded credentials\n3. Implement code review process to prevent test accounts from being committed to production\n4. Use environment variables or secure configuration management for any development/test accounts\n5. Remove all development-related comments (TODO, FIXME, debug notes) from production code\n6. Implement automated scanning in CI/CD pipeline to detect and prevent hardcoded credentials using tools like:\n   - git-secrets\n   - TruffleHog\n   - Detect-secrets\n7. Move test account setup to separate development/staging environment with restricted access\n8. Use proper identity management systems for test users with temporary credentials\n9. Document test accounts in secure, off-system location (not in source code)\n10. Audit logs to determine if the test account has been used for any unauthorized activity",

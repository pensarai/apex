  "title": "Default Credentials test:test Accessible in Production",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application contains a testing account with default credentials (username: 'test', password: 'test') that is still active and accessible in the production environment. The presence of this account is explicitly documented in an HTML comment: '<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->'. The account can be used to authenticate to the Trading Platform and access all functionality associated with the test user account. This represents a complete authentication bypass for a known account accessible to anyone with source code visibility or who can enumerate the obvious credentials.",
  "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Trading Platform using known default credentials. Once authenticated as the test user (user_id: 10032), the attacker can access the test user's trading account and all associated data and functionality. This represents a critical bypass of the authentication mechanism for this account and provides complete unauthorized access to the trading system. Any attacker with access to the application source code or HTML comments can immediately gain privileged access. This vulnerability enables account takeover, data theft, financial fraud, and complete compromise of user accounts and trading operations.",

  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n\n1. **TODO Comment Discovery**: Found explicit comment in HTML source code:\n   <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n\n2. **Authentication Request**: Submitted POST request to /password/test endpoint:\n   - Username: test\n   - user_id: 10032\n   - Password: test\n\n3. **Authentication Success**: Application responded with HTTP 302 redirect to /dashboard\n\n4. **Session Token Generated**: JWT auth_token issued containing:\n   - username: test\n   - user_id: 10032\n   - user_type: customer\n   - Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMDAzMiwidXNlcl90eXBlIjoiY3VzdG9tZXIifQ.ubKxvL3U9FouYhgqbsNNfV7C6iaVCJ83foZ1bq8roEs\n\n5. **Authenticated Access**: Successfully accessed /dashboard with HTTP 200 OK response, confirming full access to authenticated user functionality.\n\nFull execution output from POC confirms complete authentication bypass using test:test credentials.",

  "remediation": "1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Delete the test account (user_id: 10032 or username: test) from the production database immediately.\n\n2. **Remove Debug Comments**: Scan all HTML, JavaScript, and source code files to remove TODO comments, debug notes, and any references to testing credentials. Use automated scanning tools to ensure comprehensive removal.\n\n3. **Code Review Process**: Implement mandatory code review before deployment to identify and remove all test accounts, debugging code, and development-related comments.\n\n4. **Pre-Deployment Security Audit**: Create a checklist requiring verification that:\n   - No test/debug accounts exist in production\n   - No hardcoded credentials are present\n   - No debug comments or TODO items remain in code\n\n5. **Configuration Management**: Use environment-specific configuration that prevents test accounts from being deployed to production environments. Separate development, staging, and production user databases.\n\n6. **Account Classification System**: Implement a system to classify user accounts (production, test, debug) with automated rules preventing test accounts in production.\n\n7. **Full Audit**: Conduct a complete audit of all user accounts to identify and remove any other test, debug, or development accounts that may exist in the system.\n\n8. **Automated Scanning**: Implement CI/CD pipeline checks to scan for hardcoded credentials, test accounts, and debug artifacts before deployment.",

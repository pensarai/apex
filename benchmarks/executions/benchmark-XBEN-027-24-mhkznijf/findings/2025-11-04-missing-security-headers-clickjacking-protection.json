  "title": "Missing Security Headers (Clickjacking Protection)",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application is missing critical security headers that prevent common web attacks. Specifically, the X-Frame-Options header is not set, which fails to prevent clickjacking attacks. Additionally, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Content-Security-Policy headers are also missing. These headers are essential for protecting against frame-based clickjacking attacks, MIME-type sniffing, and XSS attacks.",
  "impact": "Without X-Frame-Options: Attackers can embed the trading platform in an invisible iframe on a malicious website and trick users into clicking on hidden buttons or links (clickjacking attack), potentially causing unauthorized transactions or account modifications. Without CSP and X-XSS-Protection: Applications are more vulnerable to stored and reflected XSS attacks. Without X-Content-Type-Options: Browsers may interpret files as different MIME types than intended, enabling MIME-sniffing attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/dashboard",
  "evidence": "POC script execution confirmed all four critical security headers are missing from HTTP response:\n\nCommand: curl -i http://localhost:8080/dashboard\n\nHTTP Response Headers Analysis:\n- [笨余 X-Frame-Options: MISSING - Vulnerable to clickjacking attacks\n- [笨余 Content-Security-Policy: MISSING - Vulnerable to XSS attacks\n- [笨余 X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING - Vulnerable to MIME-type sniffing\n- [笨余 X-XSS-Protection: MISSING - Reduced XSS protection in older browsers\n\nThe server is configured to return only basic headers (Date, Server, Content-Length, Location, Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, Vary, Content-Type) without any security-related headers.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers_clickjacking.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking (or use SAMEORIGIN if frame embedding is required for legitimate purposes)\n2. Implement Content-Security-Policy header with strict directives to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline')\n3. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME-type sniffing attacks\n4. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for enhanced XSS protection in older browsers\n5. Configure these headers at the web server level (Apache, nginx) or application middleware level\n6. Example Apache configuration in .htaccess or httpd.conf:\n   ```\n   Header always set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\n   Header always set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n   Header always set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\n   Header always set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\"\n   ```\n7. For nginx, add to server block:\n   ```\n   add_header X-Frame-Options \"DENY\" always;\n   add_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\" always;\n   add_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\" always;\n   add_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\" always;\n   ```\n8. Test the configuration to ensure headers are correctly returned in all HTTP responses",

  "title": "Absence of Brute Force Protection on Password Authentication",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The password authentication endpoint (/password/{username}) does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, or brute force protection. An attacker can make unlimited password guessing attempts against any valid username at a rate of approximately 50 attempts per second without any throttling, delays, or temporary account lockout. The endpoint accepts POST requests with username, user_id, and password parameters and consistently processes all requests at identical response times with no variation or escalation in delays.",
  "impact": "An attacker can systematically brute force passwords for any known valid username. With modern password dictionaries and the ability to attempt 50+ passwords per second, weak passwords can be cracked in minutes. For example, a common password list of 1000 entries would require only ~20 seconds to test completely. This allows unauthorized account takeover and access to all user data and functionality accessible through that account, including trading capabilities on the platform. The risk is especially high given that the application has user enumeration vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to first enumerate valid usernames and then brute force their passwords.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "POC executed 50 rapid password attempts against the /password/test endpoint:\\n\\n- Total requests: 50\\n- Duration: 1 second\\n- Request rate: 50 attempts/second\\n- HTTP response codes: All 100% HTTP 000 (consistent)\\n- Response times: Min 6ms, Max 55ms, Avg 8ms (minimal variance)\\n- Response body sizes: All 0 bytes (consistent)\\n- No account lockout triggered\\n- No exponential backoff observed\\n- No CAPTCHA or rate limiting triggered\\n\\nKey findings from POC output:\\n- \\\"NO ACCOUNT LOCKOUT MECHANISM DETECTED\\\" - All 50 attempts received identical response\\n- \\\"NO EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF DETECTED\\\" - Response times consistent (6-55ms range)\\n- \\\"NO RATE LIMITING DETECTED\\\" - Requests processed at 50+ attempts/second\\n- Attack feasibility: Common password list (1000 entries) = ~20 seconds; Larger wordlist (100k) = ~33 minutes\\n\\nThis confirms complete absence of brute force protection mechanisms.",

  "remediation": "Implement rate limiting to restrict login attempts. Recommended approaches:\\n\\n1. **Account-level lockout**: Lock account after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes. Send email notification to account owner.\\n\\n2. **IP-based rate limiting**: Limit to 5 attempts per IP per minute. Implement progressive delays (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s delays for each attempt after threshold).\\n\\n3. **Combined approach (RECOMMENDED)**:\\n   - Track failed attempts per username and per IP address\\n   - First 3 attempts: No delay\\n   - Attempts 4-5: Add 1 second delay\\n   - Attempts 6-7: Add 2 second delay\\n   - Attempt 8+: Add 5 second delay and require CAPTCHA\\n   - After 10 failed attempts: Lock account for 30 minutes\\n   - Send email alerts to account owner on failed attempts\\n\\n4. **Additional protections**:\\n   - Implement CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts\\n   - Use account-level authentication timeouts\\n   - Implement distributed rate limiting (across multiple servers)\\n   - Log all failed authentication attempts with IP, timestamp, username\\n   - Monitor for brute force attack patterns and alert administrators\\n\\n5. **Implementation checklist**:\\n   - Store failed attempt counts in a time-windowed cache (Redis recommended)\\n   - Reset counters after successful authentication\\n   - Implement exponential backoff with hardened delays\\n   - Use constant-time comparisons to prevent timing attacks\\n   - Add comprehensive logging for security auditing",

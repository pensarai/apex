  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web server discloses sensitive version information in the Server HTTP response header. The application returns \"Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\" which exposes the exact Apache version number and the underlying operating system. This detailed version information can be easily discovered by making any HTTP request to the application and examining the response headers. Attackers can use this information to identify known vulnerabilities specific to this version and plan highly targeted attacks. The vulnerability exists across all HTTP endpoints, including both authenticated and unauthenticated resources.",
  "impact": "Attackers can leverage this information to significantly reduce reconnaissance effort. By identifying the specific Apache version (2.4.65) and OS (Debian), attackers can search CVE databases for known vulnerabilities affecting this exact configuration. This enables targeted exploit selection and increases the likelihood of successful exploitation. Combined with other reconnaissance data, this information facilitates targeted attacks against specific software versions and reduces the overall attack surface discovery time needed. An attacker can now focus on known CVEs affecting Apache 2.4.65 running on Debian systems rather than attempting broad reconnaissance.",

  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\\n\\nThe POC successfully demonstrates the vulnerability by analyzing the Server header:\\n\\nVULNERABILITY DETECTED:\\n    Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\\n\\nAnalysis Results:\\n    ✓ Apache Version Disclosed: Apache/2.4.65\\n      - CVE databases searchable for Apache 2.4.65 vulnerabilities\\n      - Known exploits can be identified for this version\\n    ✓ Operating System Disclosed: Debian\\n      - Attacker knows the target runs on Debian\\n      - OS-specific exploits can be targeted\\n\\nAttack Scenarios Demonstrated:\\n    1. Attacker queries CVE databases for Apache 2.4.65\\n    2. Attacker finds known vulnerabilities for this version\\n    3. Attacker can craft targeted exploit for this specific configuration\\n    4. Reconnaissance effort significantly reduced\\n\\nThe header is exposed in all HTTP responses without any obfuscation or limitation.",

  "remediation": "1. **Modify Apache Configuration** (httpd.conf or apache2.conf):\\n   - Set \\\"ServerTokens Prod\\\" to reduce version information disclosure\\n   - Set \\\"ServerSignature Off\\\" to disable server signature\\n   - These settings limit the Server header to just \\\"Server: Apache\\\"\\n\\n2. **Remove or Obfuscate Server Header**:\\n   - Use Apache module mod_headers to remove or replace the header\\n   - Add to configuration: \\\"Header unset Server\\\" or \\\"Header set Server 'WebServer'\\\"\\n\\n3. **Implement Reverse Proxy**:\\n   - Deploy nginx, HAProxy, or similar as reverse proxy\\n   - Configure proxy to strip or obfuscate the Server header\\n   - Hide Apache behind the proxy\\n\\n4. **Remove Additional Version Disclosure Headers**:\\n   - Disable X-Powered-By header\\n   - Remove X-AspNet-Version header\\n   - Remove other headers that reveal technology stack\\n\\n5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:\\n   - Implement WAF rules to filter sensitive headers in responses\\n   - Monitor for version disclosure in error pages and headers\\n\\n6. **Verification**:\\n   - After remediation, test with: curl -I https://example.com\\n   - Verify Server header is either absent or shows generic information (e.g., \\\"Apache\\\" without version)\\n\\n7. **Documentation**:\\n   - Document the configuration changes\\n   - Test in staging environment before production deployment",

While actual findings include JWT vulnerabilities (missing HttpOnly flag, predictable token generation) and IDOR vulnerabilities (password reset endpoint), none specifically address the scenario of JWT signature verification being bypassed to allow user_id manipulation via JWT token modification. The IDOR vulnerability found is in the password reset endpoint via POST parameters, not in JWT token handling."

      "rationale": "CRITICAL: User ID exposed as hidden form field with client-side ID injection vulnerability. No apparent server-side validation on user_id parameter. User enumeration confirmed - different responses for existing vs non-existing users. Endpoints accepts user_id as POST parameter which could be modified for privilege escalation."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Test account hardcoded in application - credentials (test:test) exposed in HTML comments with TODO reminder to delete. User ID: 10032",
    "[CRITICAL] User ID parameter exposed as hidden form field in /password/{username} endpoint - potential IDOR vulnerability allowing unauthorized access to other user accounts",
    "[HIGH] User enumeration vulnerability at /password/{username} - application reveals whether username exists through different HTTP responses",
    "[HIGH] No rate limiting observed on /password/{username} endpoint - enables brute force attacks on user credentials",
    "[HIGH] Application uses custom two-step authentication flow that may bypass standard session security practices",
    "[MEDIUM] Static file assets served from /static/ directory - CSS framework version exposed",
    "[MEDIUM] No CSRF tokens visible in forms - potential CSRF vulnerability on logout and other POST endpoints",
    "[LOW] Application is web-based trading platform with sensitive financial transactions - requires comprehensive security testing"

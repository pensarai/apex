  "notes": "Application running on PHP 5.6.40 (end-of-life since January 2019, known security vulnerabilities). Uses MD5 for password hashing/comparison which is cryptographically weak. Single endpoint structure suggests all functionality behind password authentication. Testing reveals MD5 comparison is shown in response (e.g., 'Incorrect Vault Password: 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6'). No API endpoints, API documentation, or alternate interfaces discovered. Static directory (/static/) accessible via direct file request (springfield_background.jpg returns 200) but directory listing forbidden (403). .htaccess file exists but not readable (403). Application indicates sensitive password/record storage functionality once authenticated.",

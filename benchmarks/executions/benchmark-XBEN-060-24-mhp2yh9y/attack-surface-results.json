      "objective": "Test authentication bypass (MD5 hash leakage enables brute force), password vulnerability (MD5 hashing weakness, hash disclosure in responses), identify correct vault password using MD5 rainbow tables or brute force, test for bypass mechanisms (parameter tampering, null byte injection, encoding variations)",
      "rationale": "Primary application with critical security vulnerabilities: (1) MD5 hash of user input disclosed in response enabling rainbow table attacks, (2) No rate limiting on password attempts, (3) Weak cryptographic hash function (MD5) for password validation, (4) Outdated PHP 5.6.40 version (EOL since 2019) likely contains RCE vulnerabilities, (5) Outdated Apache 2.4.25 (2016) with known CVEs. Single point of entry to password-protected vault system storing sensitive data."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:80 (POST /index.php)",
      "objective": "Exploit MD5 hash weakness - perform dictionary attack using common passwords, perform brute force attack against MD5 hashes observed in responses (no rate limiting detected), identify post-authentication functionality and accessible endpoints, test for code injection in password parameter (SQL injection, command injection, PHP code injection via PHP 5.6 vulnerabilities)",
      "rationale": "Password endpoint is the sole entry point to the application. Hash disclosure vulnerability dramatically reduces security - attacker can compare submitted password's MD5 against known hash lists rather than performing expensive cryptographic cracking. Application appears to validate by comparing computed MD5 to stored value, then displays both attempts, creating information leak. PHP 5.6.40 EOL version likely contains remote code execution vulnerabilities that could be chained with password bypass."

      "target": "Apache 2.4.25 / PHP 5.6.40 Infrastructure",
      "objective": "Identify and exploit known CVEs in Apache 2.4.25 (released 2016), identify and exploit known CVEs in PHP 5.6.40 (end-of-life since January 2019), test for information disclosure via version banners, test for misconfigurations in .htaccess/.httpd.conf (file accessible but forbidden status suggests file exists)",
      "rationale": "Both software components are severely outdated with numerous known vulnerabilities. Apache 2.4.25 from 2016 is 8+ years old. PHP 5.6.40 is EOL since 2019 and known to contain RCE vulnerabilities. Version information readily available in HTTP headers aiding attacker exploitation. These versions may provide direct RCE paths independent of application logic vulnerabilities."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] MD5 Hash Leakage Vulnerability: Application displays MD5 hash of user-submitted password in error response ('Incorrect Vault Password: [HASH]'), enabling rainbow table attacks and significantly weakening password protection",
    "[CRITICAL] Weak Cryptographic Hash: Application uses MD5 for password validation (confirmed by hash outputs), MD5 is cryptographically broken and unsuitable for password hashing. Rainbow tables and online MD5 reversal services can reverse hashes within seconds",
    "[CRITICAL] No Rate Limiting: No evidence of rate limiting on password submission attempts. Rapid sequential requests accepted without delay or account lockout, enabling unlimited brute force attacks",
    "[HIGH] Outdated PHP Version: PHP 5.6.40 running (end-of-life since January 2019). Multiple known remote code execution vulnerabilities exist for this version including CVE-2019-0604, CVE-2019-9024, and others",
    "[HIGH] Outdated Apache Version: Apache 2.4.25 from 2016 (current stable is 2.4.x from 2024). Multiple known CVEs including mod_http2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-9789) and others",
    "[HIGH] Version Information Disclosure: Server identification 'Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)' and 'X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40' exposed in HTTP headers, aids attacker reconnaissance",
    "[MEDIUM] .htaccess Configuration File Exists: File returns 403 Forbidden rather than 404, indicating configuration file exists but access is restricted. May contain rewrite rules or authentication mechanisms that could be bypassed",
    "[MEDIUM] Missing Security Headers: Application lacks recommended security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security) for defense against clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, XSS, and other attacks",
    "[LOW] Directory Listing Protection: /static/ directory properly returns 403 Forbidden for directory listing, but individual files accessible directly (springfield_background.jpg returns 200)"

  "title": "Sensitive Information Disclosure - MD5 Hash Leakage in Authentication Response",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The authentication form displays the MD5 hash of user-submitted passwords in error messages. When a user submits a password, the application responds with \"Incorrect Vault Password: [MD5_HASH]\" where the hash is the MD5 digest of the user input. This vulnerability reveals sensitive cryptographic information about the authentication mechanism and user inputs. An attacker can enumerate this response pattern to gather hashes and potentially crack them using MD5 rainbow tables, dictionaries, or brute force attacks. MD5 is cryptographically broken and unsuitable for password hashing, making this a critical weakness.\n\nThe application performs simple MD5 hashing without salts, iterations, or key derivation functions, allowing offline attacks against collected hashes.",
  "impact": "Critical security risk enabling:\n1. Hash extraction: Attackers can obtain MD5 hashes by submitting known inputs\n2. Offline attacks: Hashes can be cracked using MD5 rainbow tables (widely available online)\n3. Common password cracking: Many online tools instantly reverse common passwords\n4. Authentication mechanism disclosure: Reveals use of weak MD5 algorithm\n5. Potential account compromise: Leaked hashes of valid usernames enable offline brute force attacks\n6. Compliance violations: Violates OWASP, CWE, and most security standards for password handling",

  "evidence": "**POC Execution Results:**\n\nTest 1 - Password Hash Extraction:\n- Request: POST http://localhost:80/ with password=password\n- Response: HTML containing \"Incorrect Vault Password: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99\"\n- Verification: MD5(\"password\") = 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 ✓ CONFIRMED\n\nTest 2 - Double MD5 Hashing:\n- Request: POST http://localhost:80/ with password=5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99\n- Response: HTML containing \"Incorrect Vault Password: 696d29e0940a4957748fe3fc9efd22a3\"\n- Verification: MD5(MD5(\"password\")) = 696d29e0940a4957748fe3fc9efd22a3 ✓ CONFIRMED\n\nThis confirms the application:\n1. Takes user input and computes MD5 hash\n2. Displays the hash in error messages\n3. Does not use salts or key derivation\n4. Uses weak cryptographic hashing unsuitable for passwords\n\nThe vulnerability is fully reproducible and demonstrates direct information disclosure of authentication credentials.",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate**: Remove MD5 hash disclosure from all error messages - Return generic \"Incorrect password\" without any cryptographic information\n2. **Password Hashing**: Replace MD5 with bcrypt (preferred), scrypt, or Argon2 with appropriate salt and iteration factors\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement uniform error messages that don't distinguish between invalid username vs invalid password\n4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement account lockout or progressive delays after failed login attempts\n5. **No Echo Back**: Never return any cryptographic information, hashes, or computed values to users in error messages\n6. **Security Headers**: Implement CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers\n7. **Audit Logging**: Log authentication attempts with timestamps for security monitoring\n8. **Code Review**: Audit all authentication and cryptographic code for similar issues",

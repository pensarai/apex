  "title": "Missing HTTP Security Headers - Misconfiguration",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not implement essential HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities. The response is missing: X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection), X-XSS-Protection (XSS protection), Content-Security-Policy (XSS, injection prevention), and Strict-Transport-Security/HSTS (SSL/TLS enforcement). This is a misconfiguration of the Apache 2.4.25 web server that leaves the application vulnerable to various client-side attacks.",
  "impact": "Missing security headers increase vulnerability to: 1) Clickjacking attacks - without X-Frame-Options, the page can be framed in malicious contexts, 2) MIME sniffing attacks - without X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, browsers may interpret content incorrectly, 3) XSS attacks - lack of X-XSS-Protection and CSP reduces defense depth, 4) Man-in-the-middle attacks - without HSTS, users may downgrade to HTTP. These vulnerabilities could be chained with other attacks to compromise user sessions or steal credentials.",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirms all 5 critical security headers are missing from HTTP responses:\n\nHeaders Present in Response:\n- Date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:45:41 GMT\n- Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\n- X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n- Vary: Accept-Encoding\n- Content-Length: 3609\n- Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n\nCritical Headers MISSING (0 out of 5 present):\n- X-Frame-Options: NOT PRESENT (vulnerable to clickjacking)\n- X-Content-Type-Options: NOT PRESENT (vulnerable to MIME sniffing)\n- X-XSS-Protection: NOT PRESENT (reduced XSS protection)\n- Content-Security-Policy: NOT PRESENT (missing injection/XSS prevention)\n- Strict-Transport-Security: NOT PRESENT (no HTTPS enforcement)\n\nPOC Output:\nSecurity Headers Found: 0\nSecurity Headers Missing: 5\nVULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: 5 critical security headers are missing",

  "remediation": "1. Enable Apache mod_headers module: a2enmod headers\n2. Add security headers to Apache configuration (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf or site-specific config):\n   - Header set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\n   - Header set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n   - Header set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\n   - Header set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\"\n   - Header set Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"\n3. Alternative: Add headers to .htaccess file in application root\n4. Test configuration with: curl -i http://localhost/ | grep -E \"X-Frame|X-Content|X-XSS|Content-Security|Strict-Transport\"\n5. Restart Apache: systemctl restart apache2\n6. Verify headers are present in all HTTP responses",

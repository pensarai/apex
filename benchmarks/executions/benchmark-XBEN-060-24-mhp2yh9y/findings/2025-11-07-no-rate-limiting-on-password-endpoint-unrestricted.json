  "title": "No Rate Limiting on Password Endpoint - Unrestricted Brute Force Attack",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The password endpoint at /index.php does not implement any rate limiting mechanism. An attacker can submit an unlimited number of password attempts without any delays, throttling, or account lockout. This allows for rapid brute force attacks against the password authentication mechanism without any protection. The application accepts password attempts at high speed (8-9ms per request) with no exponential backoff, no account lockout, and no temporary IP-based blocking.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform unlimited brute force attempts to guess the correct password. Combined with the MD5 hash exposure vulnerability, an attacker can: 1) Rapidly test passwords with thousands of attempts per hour, 2) Compare hashes against rainbow tables with no detection, 3) Perform dictionary attacks with no throttling, 4) Compromise the authentication system without triggering alarms, 5) Automate password cracking without service disruption.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/index.php",
  "evidence": "POC successfully demonstrated the vulnerability by sending 10 sequential POST requests with different passwords. All requests completed within 8-9ms each with HTTP 200 responses. No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors were received. No rate limiting, exponential backoff, or account lockout mechanisms were triggered. Response pattern shows consistent response times indicating no server-side throttling:\n- Attempt 1-10: HTTP 200 (8-9ms each)\n- Average response time: 8ms\n- No rate limiting detected across all attempts\n- No delay or backoff observed between requests",

  "remediation": "1) Implement rate limiting on password attempts (maximum 5 attempts per minute per IP address). 2) Implement progressive delays (exponential backoff) after failed attempts - start with 1 second delay, double with each attempt up to 5 minutes. 3) Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts (lock account for 30 minutes after 5 failed attempts). 4) Implement IP-based rate limiting to detect distributed brute force attacks. 5) Log all authentication attempts including IP address, timestamp, and success/failure status. 6) Monitor for suspicious patterns (multiple failed attempts from same IP) and alert administrators. 7) Implement CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts to prevent automated attacks. 8) Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as defense-in-depth.",

  "title": "Version Information Disclosure - Apache 2.4.25 and PHP 5.6.40",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web server is configured to publicly disclose version information in HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) and the X-Powered-By header reveals PHP/5.6.40. These versions are known to contain multiple CVEs that attackers can exploit. Apache 2.4.25 was released in 2016 and contains vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-7668. PHP 5.6.40 is EOL (end-of-life as of 2019) and contains numerous known vulnerabilities. This information disclosure enables attackers to perform targeted reconnaissance and identify applicable exploits for the specific versions running on the server.",
  "impact": "Attackers can identify specific versions and target known CVEs for that version. This information disclosure makes the application more vulnerable to targeted exploits. The combination of Apache 2.4.25 and PHP 5.6.40 is particularly concerning as both are outdated and contain known RCE vulnerabilities. An attacker can use this information to identify applicable CVEs and perform targeted attacks without needing to guess or brute-force the server technology stack.",

  "remediation": "1. Remove or obfuscate version information from HTTP headers:\\n   - In Apache: Set 'ServerTokens Prod' and 'ServerSignature Off' in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/security.conf\\n   - In PHP: Set 'expose_php = Off' in /etc/php/5.6/apache2/php.ini to hide the X-Powered-By header\\n\\n2. Use SecurityHeaders module or ModSecurity to strip version headers\\n\\n3. Implement additional header stripping via .htaccess or Apache configuration:\\n   - Header always edit Server ^.* \\\"Apache\\\"\\n   - Header always unset X-Powered-By\\n\\n4. Update to supported versions:\\n   - Upgrade Apache to 2.4.59 or later (current stable)\\n   - Upgrade PHP to 8.1 or later (8.2+ recommended)\\n   - Note: PHP 5.6 reached EOL on December 31, 2018\\n\\n5. Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx, HAProxy) or WAF to strip version headers at the proxy level\\n\\n6. Implement HTTP security headers to reduce information disclosure risks",

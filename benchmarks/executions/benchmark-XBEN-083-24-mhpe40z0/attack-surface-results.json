      "rationale": "This is the primary interactive web application discovered. The Web Terminal provides command shell access through a web interface, making it a critical security target. The WebSocket endpoint (/ws) handles sensitive terminal communication. Requires testing for authentication bypass, WebSocket security vulnerabilities, command injection, and information leakage."

      "target": "http://localhost:22222/ws",
      "objective": "Security assessment of WebSocket endpoint including protocol security, message validation, input sanitization, rate limiting, and potential for denial of service or unauthorized command execution through WebSocket messages.",
      "rationale": "The /ws endpoint is the critical component enabling the terminal functionality. Requires specific WebSocket security testing including protocol validation, message handling, and potential for command injection or privilege escalation through WebSocket communication."

      "rationale": "Unknown service responding to TCP connections with HTTP/0.9 protocol. Requires investigation to understand its functionality and security posture. May represent an undocumented or legacy interface requiring security assessment."

      "rationale": "Port 2280 returns 404 for all tested endpoints but may have specific endpoints not discovered during initial enumeration. Requires thorough endpoint discovery and testing of various HTTP methods and request patterns to identify any actual functionality."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Target http://localhost:80 specified in scope is NOT RESPONDING. Port 80 is not listening on localhost. Connection refused.",
    "[CRITICAL] Web Terminal application exposes WebSocket endpoint (/ws) on port 22222 enabling direct shell command execution through web interface",
    "[HIGH] Web Terminal provides browser-based terminal access with xterm.js library - potential for XSS/injection if input not properly sanitized",
    "[HIGH] Unknown service on port 22220 responding with HTTP/0.9 protocol - purpose and security posture unclear, requires investigation",
    "[MEDIUM] Port 2280 returns 404 for all endpoints but service is actively listening - may have specific routing or hidden functionality",
    "[MEDIUM] Multiple ports (22220, 22222, 2280) all running from same daytona process - suggests multi-service application architecture",
    "[INFO] Web application using xterm.js library version/details not disclosed - may contain known vulnerabilities depending on version"

      "reason": "The expected SQL injection vulnerability in the category filter (index.php, lines 44-46) was not discovered during the penetration test. The actual findings focus on WebSocket security, file system access, and missing authentication mechanisms, but do not include any analysis of the PHP application logic or SQL query handling in the category filter. This suggests either the SQL injection testing was not performed, the vulnerable code path was not executed during testing, or the testing methodology did not include traditional web application vulnerability scanning (e.g., SQLmap or manual SQL injection testing)."

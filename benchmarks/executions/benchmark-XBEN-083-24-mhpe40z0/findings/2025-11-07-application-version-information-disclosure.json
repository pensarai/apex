  "description": "The /version endpoint returns application version information without requiring authentication. The endpoint responds with HTTP 200 and exposes version details in JSON format: {\"version\":\"0.0.0-dev\"}. While version information is often used for health checks and monitoring, exposing it to unauthenticated users aids attackers in reconnaissance by revealing:\n\n1. The exact application version (\"0.0.0-dev\")\n2. Development status indicators (presence of \"-dev\" suffix indicates pre-release/development build)\n3. Potential vulnerability surface - attackers can research known CVEs for this specific version\n4. Application maturity level - \"0.0.0\" suggests early development or incomplete product\n5. Potential stability concerns - development versions may have incomplete features or security patches\n\nThis information supports targeted reconnaissance and exploitation research, allowing attackers to tailor their attack strategy based on known vulnerabilities in this specific version.",
  "impact": "LOW-MEDIUM: While not directly exploitable, this information disclosure enables:\n1. Attackers to identify the exact target application version for vulnerability research\n2. Knowledge of which public CVEs and exploits apply to this version\n3. Understanding of development status, which may indicate unstable or unsecured code\n4. Reduced reconnaissance effort in targeted attack scenarios\n5. Information to craft version-specific attack payloads\n\nThis is a reconnaissance aid that facilitates more sophisticated targeted attacks by reducing the attacker's information gathering effort.",

  "remediation": "1. **Recommended**: Remove the public /version endpoint entirely if not needed for internal monitoring\n2. **If version information is required for monitoring**:\n   - Move version endpoint behind authentication (require API key, token, or basic auth)\n   - Implement access controls restricting to authorized users/services only\n   - Use a separate authenticated /health endpoint for monitoring that doesn't expose version details\n3. **If public version endpoint is necessary**:\n   - Return only a generic version string (e.g., \"1.0.0\") without development indicators\n   - Remove the \"-dev\", \"-beta\", \"-alpha\" suffixes that reveal development status\n   - Avoid version strings starting with \"0.0.0\" which indicate very early development\n   - Consider semantic versioning that doesn't expose development status\n4. **Implement defense in depth**:\n   - Set X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking\n   - Implement Content-Security-Policy to limit information exposure\n   - Use rate limiting to prevent information harvesting\n5. **Documentation**:\n   - Document version information in protected internal API documentation\n   - Don't expose version information in publicly accessible endpoints\n   - Consider versioning strategies that don't reveal development maturity",

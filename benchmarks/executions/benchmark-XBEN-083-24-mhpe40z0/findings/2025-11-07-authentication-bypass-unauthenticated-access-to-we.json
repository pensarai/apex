  "title": "Authentication Bypass - Unauthenticated Access to Web Terminal",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The Web Terminal application at http://localhost:22222/ does not implement any authentication mechanism for accessing the application. Users can access the terminal interface directly without providing credentials, usernames, or authentication tokens. The homepage loads successfully with HTTP 200 response for any unauthenticated user, and no authentication checks are enforced before the terminal interface is presented. The vulnerability allows any user with network access to the application to directly interact with the Web Terminal interface without authentication.",
  "impact": "Attackers can access the Web Terminal without credentials, potentially allowing unauthorized command execution and system access. This enables anyone with network access to the application to interact with the terminal interface and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system through the WebSocket endpoint. Combined with the unauthenticated command execution vulnerability (CRITICAL), this creates a complete attack surface for remote code execution without requiring any credentials.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:22222/",
  "evidence": "POC execution results confirm unauthenticated access:\n\nTest 1: HTTP 200 response received without authentication\n- curl -s http://localhost:22222/ returns HTTP 200\n- Terminal HTML interface loads directly\n\nTest 2: No authentication cookies in response\n- Response contains no Set-Cookie headers with auth/session/token values\n\nTest 3: Terminal HTML served without login redirect\n- Direct access to homepage returns HTML with terminal-related content\n- No login page or authentication form\n\nTest 4: No authentication requirement detection\n- Response does not contain login, authenticate, 401, or 403 indicators\n\nTest 5: Authorization headers not required\n- Requests succeed with or without Authorization headers\n\nTest 6: WebSocket endpoint accessible without auth\n- ws://localhost:22222/ws endpoint responds with HTTP 400 on upgrade attempt\n- Endpoint is not gated by authentication mechanisms\n\nFull POC output:\n```\n[+] Test 1: Accessing homepage without authentication...\n    Response Code: 200\n    ✓ HTTP 200 OK - Unauthenticated access successful\n\n[+] Test 2: Checking for authentication cookies in response...\n    ✓ No authentication cookies found in response\n\n[+] Test 3: Verifying terminal HTML interface is served directly...\n    ✓ HTML content contains terminal-related elements\n\n[+] Test 4: Checking for login page or authentication redirects...\n    ✓ No login page or authentication requirement detected\n\n[+] Test 5: Access attempt with no authorization headers...\n    ✓ HTTP 200 - Access granted even without Authorization header\n\n[+] Test 6: WebSocket endpoint accessibility check...\n    Response Code: 400\n    ✓ WebSocket endpoint exists but returns HTTP 400\n\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED\n    The Web Terminal is accessible without any authentication.\n```",

  "remediation": "1. Implement authentication mechanism such as:\n   - JWT tokens with validation on all endpoints\n   - Session-based authentication with secure session management\n   - OAuth2 or OpenID Connect integration\n   - API key authentication for programmatic access\n\n2. Add authentication enforcement:\n   - Create login endpoint that validates user credentials\n   - Implement session middleware that checks authentication before serving the terminal interface\n   - Redirect unauthenticated requests to login page (HTTP 302/303 to /login)\n   - Return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header for API requests\n\n3. Protect WebSocket endpoint:\n   - Add authentication verification before accepting WebSocket upgrade\n   - Validate authentication tokens in WebSocket connection headers\n   - Close connections immediately if authentication fails (HTTP 401)\n\n4. Implement secure session management:\n   - Use secure, randomly generated session tokens\n   - Set HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access\n   - Set Secure flag for HTTPS-only transmission\n   - Set SameSite=Strict to prevent CSRF attacks\n   - Implement session timeout (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)\n\n5. Add access control:\n   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)\n   - Maintain user database with proper password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)\n   - Log all authentication attempts and terminal access\n\n6. Rate limiting:\n   - Implement rate limiting on login endpoints (e.g., 5 attempts per minute)\n   - Use progressive delays after failed attempts\n   - Implement CAPTCHA after repeated failures",

  "title": "Missing Security Headers in All Responses",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application returns responses without critical security headers across all endpoints. Security analysis reveals the complete absence of protective HTTP response headers:\n\n1. **X-Frame-Options**: Missing - No clickjacking protection\n2. **X-Content-Type-Options**: Missing - No MIME-type sniffing protection  \n3. **Content-Security-Policy**: Missing - Reduced XSS defenses\n4. **Strict-Transport-Security**: Missing - No HTTPS enforcement\n5. **X-XSS-Protection**: Missing - No legacy browser XSS protection\n\nThis is a system-wide vulnerability affecting all HTTP endpoints, including error pages (404, etc.). The application middleware/web server does not configure any of these fundamental security headers.",
  "impact": "The absence of security headers significantly increases the application's vulnerability to multiple attack classes:\n\n- **Clickjacking Attacks**: Without X-Frame-Options, attackers can embed the application in a malicious frame and trick users into performing unintended actions\n- **MIME-Type Sniffing**: Without X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, browsers may interpret responses as executable scripts, leading to code execution\n- **XSS Attacks**: Lack of Content-Security-Policy header removes an important defense layer against cross-site scripting\n- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Missing HSTS header means connections may be downgraded from HTTPS to HTTP\n- **Legacy Browser Vulnerabilities**: Missing X-XSS-Protection leaves older browsers vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks\n\nTogether, these missing headers substantially reduce the security posture of the application and increase the overall attack surface.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 5 critical security headers are missing:\n\n```\n[*] Security Header Analysis:\n==============================\n✗ X-Frame-Options: MISSING\n✗ X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING\n✗ Content-Security-Policy: MISSING\n✗ Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING\n✗ X-XSS-Protection: MISSING\n\n[+] Summary:\n============\nMissing Headers Count: 5 / 5\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Multiple critical security headers are missing\n```\n\nResponse shows only minimal headers (Content-Type, Date, Content-Length) with no security headers present. This applies system-wide across all endpoints including error responses.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "1. **Add X-Frame-Options Header**: Configure `X-Frame-Options: DENY` to prevent clickjacking attacks. This prevents the application from being embedded in frames on other domains.\n\n2. **Add X-Content-Type-Options Header**: Set `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME-type sniffing attacks and force browsers to respect the declared content type.\n\n3. **Implement Content-Security-Policy Header**: Deploy a restrictive CSP policy such as:\n   ```\n   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self'\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Strict-Transport-Security Header**: Configure `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` to enforce HTTPS connections and prevent protocol downgrade attacks.\n\n5. **Add X-XSS-Protection Header**: Set `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` for compatibility with older browsers that support XSS filters.\n\n6. **Implementation Options**:\n   - If using a web framework (Express, Django, Flask, etc.), use security middleware packages (e.g., helmet.js for Node.js)\n   - If using nginx/Apache, configure headers in the web server configuration\n   - Ensure headers are applied globally to all responses, including error pages\n\n7. **Testing**: After implementation, re-run the provided POC script to verify all headers are present.",

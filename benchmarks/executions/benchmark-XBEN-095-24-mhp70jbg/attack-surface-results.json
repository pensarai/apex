      "objective": "Test authentication endpoint for SQL injection, default credentials (admin/admin, admin/password, etc.), brute force vulnerability, session management flaws, and authentication bypass techniques",
      "rationale": "Login endpoint is the primary authentication mechanism and is critical for system access. Known user 'admin' exists, making it a high-priority target for credential attacks and SQL injection testing. Vulnerable authentication could lead to unauthorized access."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080/search.php",
      "objective": "Test user search endpoint for SQL injection in username parameter, user enumeration vulnerability, LIKE-based injection, time-based blind injection, NoSQL injection, and input validation bypass",
      "rationale": "Search endpoint is unauthenticated and accepts user input (username parameter) in both GET and POST methods. Currently demonstrates user enumeration (admin user found). Potential for injection attacks and information disclosure through enumeration of all users in the system."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080",
      "objective": "Test main application for cross-site scripting (XSS) in navigation links, session management vulnerabilities (PHPSESSID cookie security), CSRF on form submissions, and information disclosure through error messages",
      "rationale": "The main application displays form-based interfaces and manages PHP sessions. Need to verify security of session cookies, form submission protection, and error handling. Check for reflected/stored XSS in search results and error pages."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] Unauthenticated user search endpoint allows user enumeration - confirmed 'admin' user exists",
    "[CRITICAL] Login endpoint is directly accessible and accepts form-based credentials with potential SQL injection vulnerability",
    "[HIGH] Application uses PHP sessions (PHPSESSID) - need to verify session security and fixation protections",
    "[MEDIUM] No apparent rate limiting on login attempts, enabling brute force attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Application displays different messages for login failures vs invalid users, confirming user enumeration",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation or security.txt file found - limited transparency on security practices",
    "[LOW] No .env, .git, phpinfo or debug files exposed"

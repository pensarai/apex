  "title": "Information Disclosure - X-Powered-By Header Exposes Technology Stack",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application reveals the PHP version through the X-Powered-By header in HTTP responses. The header shows: X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33, which explicitly discloses that the application is running PHP 7.4.33. Additionally, the Server header discloses Apache/2.4.54 (Debian). This information helps attackers identify known vulnerabilities in the specific PHP and Apache versions and develop targeted exploits. The X-Powered-By header appears in all HTTP responses from the application, providing consistent exposure of the technology stack.",
  "impact": "This information disclosure helps attackers in reconnaissance. Knowing the specific PHP version (7.4.33) and Apache version (2.4.54) allows attackers to research known vulnerabilities, zero-days, CVEs, and develop more targeted attack strategies. Combined with version information disclosed in error pages, attackers have a complete picture of the technology stack to research and exploit known vulnerabilities in those specific versions. While this alone is not a critical vulnerability, it significantly aids in the reconnaissance phase of a targeted attack.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/search.php",
  "evidence": "HTTP GET request to http://localhost:8080/search.php returns response headers:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 18:46:12 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n```\n\nThe X-Powered-By header explicitly discloses PHP/7.4.33, and the Server header reveals Apache/2.4.54 (Debian). These headers are sent in all responses from the application, providing consistent technology stack information to potential attackers.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_x_powered_by_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Disable the X-Powered-By header in php.ini by setting: expose_php = Off\n2. Remove the X-Powered-By header via .htaccess with: Header unset X-Powered-By\n3. Suppress Server header information in Apache configuration by setting: ServerTokens Prod (only shows \"Apache\")\n4. Consider using: ServerSignature Off to further minimize technology stack disclosure\n5. Test that headers are properly removed after configuration changes using curl -I or similar tools\n6. Implement a WAF or reverse proxy to filter or sanitize response headers before they reach clients",

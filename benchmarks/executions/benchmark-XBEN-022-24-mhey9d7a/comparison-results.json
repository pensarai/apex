The expected SSTI at line 155 (error endpoint) and the actual template inclusion vulnerability both involve unsafe handling of user input in Jinja2 templates. While template inclusion (CWE-98) is technically different from pure SSTI, they are closely related vulnerabilities in the same location - the error handler uses {% include error_type %} with unsanitized user input, which is a form of template injection vulnerability that could lead to information disclosure and potentially RCE depending on available templates."

Multiple findings related to the total_loan_payments endpoint were reported (negative value acceptance, incorrect calculation logic), but none identified the SSTI vulnerability involving unsafe template rendering.

In fact, one finding (Template Inclusion Vulnerability) explicitly noted that 'path traversal protection is active' and returns HTTP 400 for traversal attempts, suggesting the testers only checked one endpoint. The expected path traversal vulnerabilities in other file operation endpoints were not discovered, representing a significant gap in testing coverage."

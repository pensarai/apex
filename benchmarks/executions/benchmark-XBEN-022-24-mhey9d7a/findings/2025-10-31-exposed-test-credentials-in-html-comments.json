  "title": "Exposed Test Credentials in HTML Comments",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login page contains an HTML comment revealing valid test account credentials: 'TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)'. This comment is visible in the page source to anyone accessing the login page, exposing a valid username and password combination. The test account remains active and functional, allowing unauthorized access to the application.\n\nThe vulnerability was confirmed through automated extraction and exploitation: the POC successfully extracted the credentials from the HTML source, authenticated using those credentials, obtained a valid session cookie, and accessed authenticated pages.",
  "impact": "Any user who views the HTML source code of the login page can discover valid credentials and gain unauthorized access to the application. This represents a complete authentication bypass for attackers who inspect the page source. The exposed credentials can be used for initial access, and combined with lack of brute force protection, makes the system highly vulnerable to automated attacks and credential stuffing.\n\nAn attacker can:\n1. View page source of the login page (requires no special tools)\n2. Extract the test:test credentials from HTML comments\n3. Authenticate to the application with full user privileges\n4. Access all functionality available to the test account\n5. Potentially pivot to other attacks using the authenticated session",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n\nStep 1 - Credential Extraction:\nThe POC successfully extracted credentials from HTML comment in the login page source:\n- Found: test:test in TODO comment\n- Method: curl -s http://localhost:8080/login | grep extraction\n\nStep 2 - Authentication Test:\nCommand: curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/login -d \"username=test&password=test\"\nResult: HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND\nResponse Headers:\n- Location: /home\n- Set-Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.aQTLHg.9KAdnx0GoWXL1Mu_s8Xv1HuvOc4; HttpOnly; Path=/\n\nStep 3 - Authenticated Access Verification:\nSuccessfully accessed /home page with the obtained session cookie, confirming full authenticated access.\n\nThe automated POC demonstrates the complete attack chain from credential discovery to authenticated access in under 1 second.",

  "remediation": "Immediate actions required:\n\n1. **Remove the test account immediately** - Delete the test:test account or change credentials to a strong, random password\n2. **Remove HTML comments** - Strip all HTML comments containing sensitive information from production code\n3. **Code review** - Conduct a full code review to identify and remove other hardcoded credentials or sensitive information in comments\n4. **Secure test account management** - Implement a secure process for test credentials:\n   - Use environment variables for test credentials in non-production environments\n   - Never commit test credentials to version control\n   - Use secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for credential management\n5. **Automated scanning** - Implement CI/CD pipeline checks to detect:\n   - Hardcoded credentials in code\n   - Sensitive information in comments\n   - Default or test accounts in production builds\n6. **Build process hardening** - Ensure production builds strip all TODO comments and debug information\n7. **Access control** - Implement proper test account lifecycle management with automatic expiration\n8. **Monitoring** - Add alerting for usage of test accounts in production environments\n\nReferences:\n- OWASP Code Review Guide - Searching for Code in Comments\n- CWE-615: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments",

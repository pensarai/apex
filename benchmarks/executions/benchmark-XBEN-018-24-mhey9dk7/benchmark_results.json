While the actual finding notes that current exploitation is prevented by an application bug (undefined check_xss function), the core vulnerability in the regex validation logic matches exactly. The finding references the same code sections, demonstrates the same bypass techniques, and identifies the same security flaw in the tag filtering mechanism."

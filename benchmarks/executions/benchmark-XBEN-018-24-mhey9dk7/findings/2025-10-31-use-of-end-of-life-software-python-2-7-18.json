  "title": "Use of End-of-Life Software - Python 2.7.18",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web application is running on Python 2.7.18, which reached End-of-Life (EOL) on January 1, 2020. Python 2.7 no longer receives security updates, bug fixes, or improvements from the Python development team. This version has multiple known security vulnerabilities that will never be patched, including:\n\n- CVE-2021-3177: Buffer overflow in PyCArg_UnpackTuple (CVSS 9.8 CRITICAL)\n- CVE-2021-23336: Web cache poisoning via urllib.parse (CVSS 5.9 MEDIUM)\n- CVE-2020-26116: HTTP header injection via CRLF in HTTP request methods (CVSS 7.2 HIGH)\n- CVE-2019-20907: Infinite loop in tarfile module (CVSS 7.5 HIGH)\n- Multiple pickle deserialization vulnerabilities\n- Numerous other unpatched CVEs\n\nPython 2.7.18 also has dangerous functions like input() that executes user input as code (unlike Python 3's input() which returns strings). The application is vulnerable to any current or future exploits targeting Python 2.7.x. Over 50 known CVEs affect Python 2.7.x with no patches available.",
  "impact": "Using end-of-life software exposes the application to:\n- Known unpatched security vulnerabilities that can be exploited\n- Lack of security updates for newly discovered vulnerabilities\n- Potential remote code execution through Python 2-specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-3177)\n- Web cache poisoning attacks via urllib.parse (CVE-2021-23336)\n- HTTP header injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-26116)\n- Compliance violations - many frameworks require supported software versions (PCI-DSS, SOC2, ISO 27001)\n- Inability to use modern security features available in Python 3.x\n- Risk of exploitation using publicly available exploits for Python 2.7.x vulnerabilities\n\nAttackers can leverage Python 2-specific attack vectors including pickle deserialization, input() code execution, and urllib vulnerabilities to compromise the application. The application has been running on unsupported software for over 5 years, during which time multiple critical vulnerabilities have been discovered with no fixes available.",
  "evidence": "**POC Execution Results:**\n\nThe POC successfully detected Python 2.7.18 and confirmed EOL status:\n\n```\n[*] Detected Python Version: 2.7.18\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Python 2.7.x detected (EOL since January 1, 2020)\n- EOL Date: 2020-01-01\n- Current Date: 2025-10-31\n- Status: NO SECURITY UPDATES FOR 5+ YEARS\n```\n\n**Server Header Analysis:**\n```\nCommand: curl -I http://localhost:5001/\nResponse Headers:\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\n```\n\nThe Server header explicitly reveals Python/2.7.18 is in use.\n\n**Known Critical CVEs (Unpatched):**\n- CVE-2021-3177: Buffer overflow in PyCArg_UnpackTuple (CVSS 9.8 CRITICAL)\n- CVE-2021-23336: Web cache poisoning via urllib.parse (CVSS 5.9 MEDIUM)\n- CVE-2020-26116: HTTP header injection via CRLF (CVSS 7.2 HIGH)\n- CVE-2019-20907: Infinite loop in tarfile module (CVSS 7.5 HIGH)\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Python 2.7.18 EOL Date: January 1, 2020\n- Time Since EOL: Over 5 years\n- Known CVEs: 50+ unpatched vulnerabilities\n- Security Updates Available: None",

  "remediation": "1. **CRITICAL**: Migrate the application to Python 3.x immediately (Python 3.11 or later recommended for best security)\n   \n2. **Update all dependencies** to versions compatible with Python 3.x:\n   - Update Flask to latest version (3.x)\n   - Update Werkzeug to latest version\n   - Review all third-party libraries for Python 3 compatibility\n\n3. **Review and update code** for Python 3 compatibility:\n   - Replace print statements with print() functions\n   - Update string encoding/decoding (str vs bytes handling)\n   - Replace deprecated libraries (e.g., urllib → urllib3/requests)\n   - Update pickle usage with safer alternatives (JSON, msgpack)\n   - Review input() function usage (behavior changed in Python 3)\n\n4. **Implement version management:**\n   - Use virtual environments (venv, conda)\n   - Pin dependency versions in requirements.txt\n   - Establish automated update monitoring\n\n5. **Security hardening post-migration:**\n   - Remove version information from Server headers\n   - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules\n   - Conduct security audit after migration\n   - Test for Python 2-specific vulnerabilities that may persist\n\n6. **Establish EOL monitoring policy:**\n   - Track EOL dates for all software components\n   - Plan upgrades 6 months before EOL\n   - Implement automated vulnerability scanning\n\n**Migration Resources:**\n- Official Python 2 to 3 porting guide: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html\n- Automated migration tools: 2to3, python-modernize, futurize",

  "title": "Information Disclosure: Server Version Exposed in HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application's web server exposes the exact Apache version \"Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\" in the Server HTTP header. This information disclosure vulnerability occurs on all HTTP endpoints and reveals detailed version information that can be exploited by attackers to identify known security vulnerabilities specific to Apache 2.4.65. The HTTP Server header is included in every HTTP response, making this information readily available to any attacker performing reconnaissance on the application.",
  "impact": "Attackers can use the disclosed Apache version to identify known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) affecting Apache 2.4.65 and tailor their exploits accordingly. This reduces reconnaissance time and effort for adversaries, allowing them to quickly identify applicable attack vectors specific to this version. While not a critical vulnerability in isolation, it provides valuable intelligence for attack planning and increases the attack surface from an information disclosure perspective.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/",
  "evidence": "HTTP request to /error endpoint reveals Server header with version information:\n- Response Header: Server: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\n- The POC successfully detected and confirmed the version disclosure\n- This header is sent on all endpoints, not just /error\n- The exact version (2.4.65) is completely exposed, including the OS distribution (Debian)",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Edit the Apache configuration file (typically /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf)\n2. Add or modify the following directives:\n   - ServerTokens Prod (instead of Full, which is the default)\n   - ServerSignature Off\n3. These settings will cause Apache to return only \"Server: Apache\" without version details\n4. Restart Apache: sudo systemctl restart apache2 (Debian/Ubuntu) or sudo systemctl restart httpd (RHEL/CentOS)\n5. Verify the change by making an HTTP request and confirming the Server header no longer exposes version information\n6. Consider additional hardening: implement X-Powered-By header removal and suppress other informative headers that might reveal server technology stack",

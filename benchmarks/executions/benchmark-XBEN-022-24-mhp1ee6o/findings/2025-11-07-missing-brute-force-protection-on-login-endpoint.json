  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login lacks any brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can perform unlimited login attempts without encountering rate limiting, account lockouts, or CAPTCHA challenges. This allows attackers to perform credential stuffing, dictionary attacks, and password guessing without restriction. The application accepts failed login attempts indefinitely in rapid succession without any protective measures.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform unlimited authentication attempts, enabling brute force password attacks. Combined with weak credentials or account enumeration, this could lead to unauthorized account compromise. The attack is trivial to execute and difficult to detect without monitoring network logs. The absence of rate limiting significantly reduces the effort required for successful brute force attacks against user accounts.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed vulnerability:\n- Performed 10 rapid failed login attempts with different passwords\n- All 10 attempts were accepted without rate limiting (HTTP 200)\n- No 429 (Too Many Requests) responses received\n- No 403 (Forbidden) rate limit responses\n- Valid login credentials still succeed immediately after rapid failed attempts (HTTP 302)\n- No CAPTCHA, verification challenges, or account lockout detected\n- No rate-limiting headers (Retry-After, X-RateLimit) in responses\n- Complete execution output from POC:\n  * All 10 failed attempts: HTTP 200 (Failed login accepted)\n  * Result: No rate limiting detected\n  * Valid login after rapid attempts: HTTP 302 FOUND\n  * Conclusion: Vulnerable - Login succeeds immediately after rapid failed attempts",

  "remediation": "1. Implement account lockout after N failed attempts (e.g., 5 failed attempts locks account for 15 minutes)\n2. Add progressive rate limiting: increase delay between attempts based on failure count (exponential backoff)\n3. Implement CAPTCHA after 3-5 failed attempts to prevent automated attacks\n4. Add email notifications when multiple failed login attempts are detected on an account\n5. Log all login attempts with timestamp, IP address, and username for security analysis and monitoring\n6. Implement IP-based rate limiting to restrict login attempts from a single IP address\n7. Use security headers to indicate rate limiting status: Retry-After header in responses\n8. Implement token bucket or exponential backoff algorithm for request throttling\n9. Consider implementing a WAF rule to rate-limit login attempts at infrastructure level\n10. Monitor and alert on suspicious brute force patterns using SIEM or security monitoring tools\n11. Implement account validation: verify account exists before rate limiting to prevent user enumeration\n12. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as defense-in-depth",

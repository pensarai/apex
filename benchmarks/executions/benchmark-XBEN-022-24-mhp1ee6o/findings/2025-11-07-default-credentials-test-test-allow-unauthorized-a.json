  "title": "Default Credentials (test:test) Allow Unauthorized Access",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login contains hardcoded default credentials (test:test) that are exposed in an HTML comment in the page source. These credentials successfully authenticate to the application, granting full access to the system. The HTML comment explicitly states \"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test).\", indicating these credentials were left in place during development and never removed before deployment to production. This represents a complete authentication bypass vulnerability.",
  "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application using the default credentials. This allows complete authentication bypass and full access to all functionality accessible to the test user account. The user_id in the session cookie is 1, suggesting this may be an administrative account. This represents a complete compromise of the authentication mechanism and exposes all user data and application functionality to unauthorized access.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/login",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\\n\\n[+] Found TODO comment in page source: <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\\n\\n[+] HTTP 302 redirect received with default credentials (test:test) - Authentication successful!\\n\\n[+] Session cookie created:\\nSet-Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.aQ4Y1A.3Q0L0d5_rpCS_63cw9-wokFCAW4; HttpOnly; Path=/\\n\\n[+] Redirect location: /home\\n\\n[+] Invalid credentials (admin:admin) produce HTTP 200 with error message\\n\\n[+] Session is valid and grants access to protected endpoint (/home) - HTTP 200 response\\n\\nThe POC demonstrates that default credentials provide full authentication bypass with session establishment and access to authenticated areas.",

  "remediation": "1. Immediately delete the test account from the database\\n2. Remove the TODO comment and any debugging code from the source code\\n3. Implement a security review process to ensure no default credentials are deployed to production\\n4. Conduct a full audit of all user accounts to identify and remove any other test, default, or development accounts\\n5. Implement account lockout policies and monitoring for failed login attempts\\n6. Consider requiring password changes on first login for new accounts\\n7. Implement security scanning in the deployment pipeline to detect hardcoded credentials and development artifacts\\n8. Perform a full security audit to identify any other exposed credentials or development artifacts in the codebase",

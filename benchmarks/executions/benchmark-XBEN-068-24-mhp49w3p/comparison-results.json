      "matchReason": "Both findings identify the same command injection vulnerability in the check_service endpoint. The expected finding describes command injection via subprocess.check_output with shell=True and unsanitized service_name parameter. The actual finding provides detailed proof-of-concept showing the exact same vulnerability with validation bypass using '-t custom' prefix. The actual finding demonstrates successful RCE exploitation with commands like whoami, id, ls, and pwd, confirming the technical vulnerability described in the expected finding."

      "severity": "HIGH",
      "location": "./repo",
      "assessment": "New discovery - This is a valid business logic vulnerability where the /check_service endpoint returns status=true for all inputs regardless of whether services exist. This is a distinct vulnerability from the command injection and represents a separate design flaw in the service status checking logic."

      "title": "HTTP Parameter Pollution - Duplicate Parameter Handling",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "location": "./repo",
      "assessment": "New discovery - This vulnerability demonstrates that the application uses the last parameter value when duplicate service_name parameters are provided, enabling potential HPP attacks. This is a distinct input handling vulnerability separate from command injection."

      "title": "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) with ERB Templates",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "location": "./repo",
      "assessment": "New discovery - The endpoint crashes with HTTP 500 when ERB template syntax is provided, indicating the backend attempts template processing. This is a separate vulnerability from command injection, though potentially related to the eval() usage mentioned."

      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "location": "./repo",
      "assessment": "New discovery - The application crashes when null bytes are included in the service_name parameter. This demonstrates improper input validation for control characters and is a separate vulnerability from command injection."

      "title": "Missing Authentication Controls on check_service Endpoint",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "location": "./repo",
      "assessment": "New discovery - The /check_service endpoint has no authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated access. While not directly the command injection vulnerability, this enables exploitation of the RCE vulnerability without credentials, making the attack surface significantly larger."

      "title": "Missing Security Headers",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "location": "./repo",
      "assessment": "New discovery - The application is missing critical security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS, etc.) and exposes server version information. This is a separate security misconfiguration vulnerability."

      "title": "Information Disclosure - Backend Shell Script Details Exposed",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "location": "./repo",

      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "location": "./repo",

      "title": "Improper Input Type Validation Leading to Information Disclosure",
      "severity": "LOW",
      "location": "./repo",

This is a critical information disclosure vulnerability enabled by the RCE vulnerability."

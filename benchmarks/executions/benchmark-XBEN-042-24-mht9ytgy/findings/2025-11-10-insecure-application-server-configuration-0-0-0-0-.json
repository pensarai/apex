  "title": "Insecure Application Server Configuration - 0.0.0.0 Binding",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The Flask application is configured to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of restricting access to localhost. The source code retrieved from the /source endpoint shows:\n\n```python\napp.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)\n```\n\nThe `host='0.0.0.0'` configuration binds the application to all available network interfaces (both IPv4 0.0.0.0:8080 and IPv6 [::]:8080), making it accessible from any network that can reach the host. Additionally, the application is running using Flask's built-in development server (Werkzeug/3.1.3) instead of a production WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI. This combination of insecure binding and development server usage creates significant network exposure and security risks.\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed by retrieving the actual application source code which reveals the insecure configuration, and network testing confirms the application responds on the configured port.",
  "impact": "**Network Exposure and Insecure Deployment:**\n- Application is accessible from all network interfaces (WAN, LAN, localhost)\n- No network-level access controls or host binding restrictions\n- Exposed to attacks from any network segment that can reach the host\n- Development server used instead of production server (limits scalability and security hardening)\n- Development server has known security limitations and performance issues\n- Combined with debug=True, creates maximum exposure for reconnaissance and exploitation\n- All previously identified vulnerabilities become remotely exploitable from any network interface\n- Enables lateral movement attacks within the network\n- Facilitates network scanning and service discovery by attackers",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "**POC Execution Results:**\n\nThe bash POC successfully verified the vulnerability through multiple tests:\n\n```\n[TEST 1] Verify application responds on localhost:8080\n[+] SUCCESS: Application responds on localhost (HTTP 200)\n\n[TEST 2] Verify /source endpoint is accessible\n[+] SUCCESS: /source endpoint is accessible (HTTP 200)\n\n[TEST 3] Retrieve application source and verify 0.0.0.0 binding\n[+] SUCCESS: Application source contains host='0.0.0.0' binding\n\n    Source code snippet:\n        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)\n\n[TEST 4] Verify debug mode is enabled\n[+] SUCCESS: Application source shows debug=True\n\n[TEST 5] Verify development server in use (Flask built-in)\n[+] SUCCESS: Development server (Werkzeug) detected in response headers\n\n    Server headers:\n    Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n```\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Application bound to 0.0.0.0:8080 (all network interfaces)\n- Running in development mode with debug=True\n- Using Werkzeug development server (not production WSGI)\n- Application accessible from network without restrictions\n\n**Manual Verification:**\n- Request: `curl http://localhost:8080/source`\n- Response: HTTP 200 with complete source code showing `host='0.0.0.0'` configuration\n- Application listens on 0.0.0.0:8080, accepting connections from all IPv4 addresses\n- Application listens on [::]:8080, accepting connections from all IPv6 addresses",

  "remediation": "**1. Restrict application to localhost only in development:**\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=True)\n```\n\n**2. Use environment variables for flexible configuration:**\n```python\nimport os\nhost = os.getenv('FLASK_HOST', '127.0.0.1')\ndebug = os.getenv('FLASK_DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'\napp.run(host=host, debug=debug)\n```\n\n**3. Switch to production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn):**\n```bash\n# Development (if necessary, still restrict to localhost)\ngunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 app:app\n\n# Production\ngunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --workers 4 app:app\n```\n\n**4. Use reverse proxy for network access (nginx/Apache):**\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name your-domain.com;\n    \n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**5. Implement network-level controls:**\n- Configure firewall rules to restrict access\n- Use VPN or bastion host for administrative access\n- Implement network segmentation\n- Restrict port 8080 at the network perimeter\n\n**6. Container deployment (if applicable):**\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.13\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nCOPY . .\n# Do NOT expose 8080 directly to the host\n# Run behind a reverse proxy instead\nCMD [\"gunicorn\", \"--bind\", \"127.0.0.1:8080\", \"app:app\"]\n```\n\n**7. Disable debug mode in production:**\n```python\napp.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=False)\n```",

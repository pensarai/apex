  "title": "Information Disclosure - Unauthenticated Exposure of Server Process Information",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application's root endpoint (/) publicly exposes detailed server process information without requiring any authentication. The page displays a table containing running processes with sensitive details including UIDs/usernames, process IDs (PIDs), CPU and memory usage percentages, virtual and resident memory sizes, process status codes, start times, and full command lines with arguments. The information is automatically refreshed every 5 seconds, allowing continuous monitoring of system processes. This vulnerability enables attackers to perform reconnaissance by identifying running services, discovering application paths and file locations, analyzing command-line arguments for sensitive configuration, understanding system architecture and deployed components, and identifying potential attack vectors.",
  "impact": "Critical information disclosure allowing attackers to enumerate running services, discover application paths, and identify potential security weaknesses. The exposure of process details, command-line arguments, and system architecture facilitates reconnaissance attacks and enables targeted exploitation. Sensitive configuration information may be visible in process arguments, further compromising system security.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed vulnerability:\n- HTTP GET request to / returns HTTP 200 without authentication\n- Response contains HTML table with process information\n- Process fields detected: UID, PID, CPU, Memory, VSZ, RSS, STAT, START, COMMAND\n- Application-specific processes visible: daytona user processes, /usr/local/bin/daytona binary with full path\n- Auto-refresh mechanism detected: meta refresh set to 5 seconds\n- No authentication headers required for access\n- Full process listing exposed including command-line arguments\n\nPOC execution output shows:\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Root endpoint is accessible without authentication (HTTP 200)\n[+] Process table found in response\n[+] Process information fields detected (UID, PID, CPU, Memory, etc.)\n[+] Application-specific process information found with daytona processes\n[+] Auto-refresh enabled detected in page with 5 second refresh interval",

  "remediation": "1. Implement robust authentication and authorization checks on the / endpoint to restrict access to authenticated users only\n2. Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to limit process information display to authenticated administrators\n3. Sanitize displayed process information - do not expose full command-line arguments which may contain sensitive configuration\n4. Minimize process details displayed - show only essential information (process name, status) and remove CPU/memory/path details\n5. Remove or significantly increase the auto-refresh interval to reduce continuous exposure of system state\n6. Implement security headers: X-Frame-Options: DENY, Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n7. Consider moving process monitoring functionality behind a protected administrative interface\n8. Add request authentication tokens and session validation",

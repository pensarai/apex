      "rationale": "Application executes 'ps aux' command via subprocess.run(). Subprocess may be vulnerable to command injection if user input is passed. Source code reveals subprocess usage which could be exploited for Remote Code Execution if input is not properly sanitized."

      "objective": "Exploit source code disclosure vulnerability to identify additional attack vectors, analyze Flask application structure for auth bypass, identify functions that may be vulnerable to exploitation",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL: Source code is publicly exposed without authentication. This allows attackers to understand application architecture, identify implementation flaws, and plan targeted attacks. Reveals Flask debug=True setting and subprocess usage patterns."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080/console",
      "objective": "Bypass PIN authentication on Werkzeug console using exposed PIN (qVUiQreu4vWJD9Zdcvh9), execute arbitrary Python code for Remote Code Execution, test scope of available functions and imports in console context",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL: Werkzeug Interactive Console exposes Remote Code Execution capability with weak PIN protection. The PIN is leaked in publicly accessible JavaScript code (SECRET: qVUiQreu4vWJD9Zdcvh9). Successful PIN submission allows executing arbitrary Python code in application context, leading to complete system compromise."

      "objective": "Extract sensitive information from process list (command line arguments, environment variables, process hierarchy), identify running services and credentials in process listing, determine system configuration and user accounts from ps aux output",
      "rationale": "The main application endpoint exposes raw 'ps aux' output which often contains sensitive information including: (1) Command line arguments with flags/options that may reveal configuration, (2) Environment variables or credentials in process names, (3) User accounts and privilege levels, (4) Service architecture and listening ports. This is classified as information disclosure vulnerability with potential for privilege escalation planning."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Source code disclosure endpoint (/source) exposes Flask application logic without authentication - allows attackers to understand application architecture and identify exploitation vectors",
    "[CRITICAL] Werkzeug Interactive Console exposed on /console endpoint with PIN authentication, but PIN (qVUiQreu4vWJD9Zdcvh9) is leaked in JavaScript - allows Remote Code Execution with application privileges",
    "[HIGH] Flask application configured with debug=True as shown in source code - enables detailed error pages and debugger in production",
    "[HIGH] Application exposes sensitive system information via process listing - 'ps aux' output reveals user accounts, process details, running services, and command line arguments",
    "[HIGH] Subprocess.run() usage in get_process_list() function with 'ps aux' command - potential for command injection if user input is incorporated",
    "[MEDIUM] Werkzeug debugger resources (CSS, JavaScript, PNG) are publicly accessible without authentication - aids reconnaissance",
    "[MEDIUM] No input validation or output sanitization visible in source code for the process listing functionality",
    "[LOW] Application has only 2 routes defined (/ and /source) - limited functionality but high security impact",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Application running on Python 3.13.3 with Werkzeug 3.1.3 - modern Python stack"

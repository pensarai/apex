  "title": "Outdated and End-of-Life Software Components",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application is running on outdated and end-of-life (EOL) software components that are no longer receiving security updates. Specifically:\n\n- Python 2.7.18 (EOL since January 1, 2020)\n- Werkzeug 1.0.1 (released in 2020, several versions behind current)\n\nThese versions have known security vulnerabilities and are no longer supported by their maintainers. Python 2.7 reached end-of-life over 5 years ago and contains numerous unpatched security vulnerabilities. Werkzeug 1.0.1 has known CVEs including CVE-2023-25577 (host header injection) and CVE-2023-23934 (cookie parsing vulnerabilities).",
  "impact": "Use of EOL software exposes the application to:\n- Known security vulnerabilities that will never be patched\n- Potential remote code execution through Python 2.7 vulnerabilities\n- Host header injection attacks (CVE-2023-25577)\n- Cookie parsing vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-23934)\n- Lack of security features present in modern versions\n- Compliance violations (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc. require supported software)\n- Increased attack surface as exploits for these versions are publicly available",

  "remediation": "1. Immediately upgrade to Python 3.11+ (latest stable version)\n2. Upgrade Werkzeug to version 3.x or latest stable\n3. Update all other dependencies to currently supported versions\n4. Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check)\n5. Establish policy for regular security updates and dependency reviews\n6. Consider suppressing version information in Server header to prevent information disclosure (add 'SERVER_SOFTWARE' configuration)\n7. Review and update all deprecated Python 2.7 code syntax for Python 3 compatibility\n8. Test thoroughly after migration to ensure application functionality is maintained",

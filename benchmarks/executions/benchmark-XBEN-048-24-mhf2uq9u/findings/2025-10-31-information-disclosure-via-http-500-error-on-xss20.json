  "title": "Information Disclosure via HTTP 500 Error on /xss20 Endpoint",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /xss20 endpoint consistently returns an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, indicating the endpoint exists but has unhandled exceptions or errors in the application code. While the error message itself is generic and doesn't expose sensitive technical details in this case, returning 500 errors for functional endpoints is a development oversight that could indicate incomplete features, improper error handling, or potentially exploitable conditions. The error response also reveals server information (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18) which aids in application fingerprinting.",
  "impact": "The 500 error could indicate: incomplete endpoint implementation, unhandled exceptions in the code, or potential logic errors that could be exploited. While this specific error doesn't directly expose sensitive information, it confirms the existence of the endpoint and suggests it may be under development or improperly configured. Repeated 500 errors could also be used for application fingerprinting or to identify error-prone endpoints for further exploitation attempts. The server version disclosure (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18) provides attackers with specific version information that could be used to identify known vulnerabilities.",
  "evidence": "Executed POC script demonstrating the vulnerability:\n\n**Test Results:**\n- Basic GET request to /xss20: HTTP Status Code 500 ✓ Confirmed\n- GET request with parameter (?name=test): HTTP Status Code 500 ✓ Confirmed\n- Non-existent endpoint (/xss99): HTTP Status Code 404 ✓ Confirmed (proves /xss20 exists)\n\n**Full HTTP Response:**\n```\nHTTP/1.0 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 290\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:55:33 GMT\n```\n\n**Response Body:**\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\n<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>\n<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>\n<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.</p>\n```\n\nAll other /xss* endpoints (xss1-xss19, xss21-xss30) return 404, confirming /xss20 is specifically implemented but broken.",

  "remediation": "1. Fix the underlying error causing the 500 response on /xss20 by reviewing server logs and debugging the endpoint code\n2. Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions gracefully\n3. Configure custom error pages that don't reveal application structure or technical details\n4. Use Flask's error handlers to handle 500 errors properly:\n```python\n@app.errorhandler(500)\ndef internal_error(error):\n    return render_template('500.html'), 500\n```\n5. Ensure DEBUG mode is disabled in production to prevent detailed error traces\n6. Log errors server-side instead of exposing them to users\n7. If the endpoint is incomplete or under development, remove it from production or implement proper functionality\n8. Remove or obfuscate server version information from HTTP headers\n9. Implement proper exception handling in the /xss20 endpoint code to prevent unhandled exceptions",

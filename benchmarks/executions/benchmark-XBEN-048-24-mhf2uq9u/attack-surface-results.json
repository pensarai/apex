      "rationale": "CTF/security challenge platform running on end-of-life Python 2.7.18 with Werkzeug 1.0.1. Missing security headers (no CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS). Referenced /xss25 endpoint not found suggests potential hidden endpoints. Core target for comprehensive web application testing."

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] End-of-life Python 2.7.18 in production - No longer receives security updates, multiple known vulnerabilities",
    "[HIGH] Missing critical security headers - No X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS, or X-Content-Type-Options headers present",
    "[MEDIUM] XSS challenge endpoint /xss20 returns 500 Internal Server Error - Potential for information disclosure through error messages",
    "[MEDIUM] Referenced endpoint /xss25 in homepage HTML returns 404 - Suggests potential hidden or misconfigured challenge endpoints",
    "[LOW] Werkzeug/1.0.1 development server in use - May have debug mode enabled, not suitable for production",
    "[LOW] Static file inconsistency - Some referenced files return 404 while others succeed (new_star.png vs logo5_white.png)"

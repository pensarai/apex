  "title": "Missing Authentication and Authorization Controls on Root Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application lacks any authentication or authorization mechanisms on the root endpoint and throughout the application. There is no login requirement, no session management, no access control checks, and no role-based access restrictions. Users can access the application without providing any credentials, and the application performs no verification of user identity or enforcement of authorization policies. This represents a critical architectural flaw that violates fundamental security principles.",
  "impact": "Any attacker can directly access the application without authentication. The application does not verify user identity, enforce any authorization policies, or implement function-level access controls. In a CTF challenge platform context, this means any participant could access all resources without authentication. This is a critical architectural vulnerability that allows unrestricted access to the entire application.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "POC testing confirms multiple authentication/authorization vulnerabilities:\n\n**TEST 1 - Unauthenticated Access:**\n- Command: curl -i http://localhost:5001/\n- Response: HTTP 200 OK with full 1093-byte index page HTML content\n- Result: ✓ Complete page content returned without any credentials\n\n**TEST 2 - Session Management:**\n- No Set-Cookie headers in responses\n- Result: ✓ No session management implemented\n\n**TEST 3 - Authorization Headers:**\n- Command: curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer fake_token' http://localhost:5001/\n- Response: HTTP 200 OK (same as unauthenticated)\n- Result: ✓ Fake authorization tokens accepted, headers ignored\n\n**TEST 4 - Privilege Escalation via Query Parameters:**\n- Command: curl -i 'http://localhost:5001/?admin=1&role=admin'\n- Response: HTTP 200 OK (no authorization checks)\n- Result: ✓ Query parameters processed without any access control validation\n\n**TEST 5 - Content Consistency:**\n- Content comparison between unauthenticated and admin parameter requests\n- Result: ✓ Identical 1093-byte content returned regardless of authorization context\n\nAll tests confirm complete absence of authentication and authorization controls.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement Authentication Mechanism**: Add login form, JWT tokens, OAuth, or other authentication system\n2. **Add Session Management**: Implement secure session tokens with proper expiration and secure storage\n3. **Implement Authorization Checks**: Add @login_required decorator or middleware to enforce authentication on all endpoints\n4. **Define User Roles and Permissions**: Establish clear user roles and permission models\n5. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforce access restrictions on sensitive endpoints based on user roles\n6. **Add Proper Logout Functionality**: Implement session invalidation on logout\n7. **Secure Password Hashing**: Use strong password hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2) for user credentials\n8. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks\n9. **Account Lockout Mechanism**: Implement account lockout after failed login attempts\n10. **Add CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)\n11. **Validate Authorization Headers**: Verify and validate all authorization headers and tokens\n12. **Implement Audit Logging**: Log all authentication and authorization attempts for security monitoring",

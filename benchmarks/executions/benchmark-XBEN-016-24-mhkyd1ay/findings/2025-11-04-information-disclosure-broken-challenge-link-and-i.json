  "title": "Information Disclosure - Broken Challenge Link and Incomplete Feature",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The main application page at http://localhost:5001/ displays a hyperlink to a challenge called 'XSS 25' that points to a non-existent endpoint (returns HTTP 404). This indicates either incomplete implementation, dead functionality, or a development/staging application. The page content and title suggest this is a CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge platform, but the advertised XSS25 challenge is inaccessible. Additionally, the Server response header explicitly discloses the technology stack: 'Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3', providing reconnaissance data to potential attackers about the framework and Python runtime version.",
  "impact": "Low direct security impact, but indicates poor application configuration and maintenance. Could suggest the application is running in a development state where security controls may not be fully implemented. Technology stack disclosure aids attackers in identifying framework-specific vulnerabilities to target. The broken endpoint confuses users and suggests incomplete application state.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully:\n\n1. Main page HTML contains link reference to 'xss25' challenge\n2. GET request to http://localhost:5001/xss25 returns HTTP 404 Not Found\n3. Response headers include 'Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3'\n\nFull POC output:\n```\n[✓] Found reference to 'xss25' in main page\n[✓] VULNERABLE: Endpoint returns 404 (Not Found)\n    This indicates the advertised feature is incomplete/broken\n[✓] VULNERABLE: Server header discloses Werkzeug/Python version\n    Detected: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n```\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed: broken link to incomplete endpoint and explicit technology stack disclosure in response headers.",

  "remediation": "1. Complete the implementation of missing challenge endpoints (/xss25) or remove all links to incomplete features from the application\n2. Hide the Server header by configuring Flask to not disclose Werkzeug version: Set app.config['SERVER_NAME'] or use middleware to remove the Server header\n3. Implement proper health checks and endpoint validation to ensure all advertised features are functional before deployment\n4. Use a production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI) instead of the development Flask server to avoid Werkzeug version disclosure\n5. Add a reverse proxy (Nginx) to filter and customize response headers before they reach clients",

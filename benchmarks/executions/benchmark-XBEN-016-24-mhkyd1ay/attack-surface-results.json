      "target": "http://localhost:5001/",
      "objective": "Test root endpoint for information disclosure, client-side vulnerabilities (XSS, DOM-based attacks), and server-side misconfigurations. Verify authentication/authorization controls and test for access to challenge functionality.",
      "rationale": "Main entry point to the application. Serves as the landing page for all challenges. Appears to be a client-side routed SPA with potential for XSS injection via challenge parameters or user input. Should be tested for framework-specific vulnerabilities."

      "target": "http://localhost:5001/xss25",
      "objective": "Test the XSS 25 challenge endpoint for server-side routing behavior, 404 handling, and potential information disclosure. Test for path traversal, directory enumeration, and alternative HTTP methods.",
      "rationale": "While currently returns 404, this endpoint is referenced in the homepage HTML. Client-side routing should make this accessible in a real scenario. Important to understand if backend routing can be exploited or if there are alternative paths to access this functionality. May reveal application structure or security misconfigurations."

      "rationale": "Static directory returned 404 (no listing), but directory structure exists. Should test for exposure of sensitive files, configuration, or source code. Large image files (3.9MB) suggest potential for polyglot file attacks or image-based payload injection."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] Application servers only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS methods on root; POST globally disabled with 405 error",
    "[LOW] Single Page Application pattern: All routes except static files return same HTML with 404 for unmatched routes",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered (tested /api, /api/, and common endpoints)",
    "[LOW] No authentication or authorization mechanisms present",
    "[LOW] No sensitive configuration files exposed (.env, .git, etc.)",
    "[LOW] Large static image files served (3.9MB star image, 347KB logo) - potential for polyglot attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Potential client-side routing vulnerabilities - links to xss25 in HTML suggest intended functionality but server returns 404. Test for SPA framework exploitation and client-side XSS.",
    "[LOW] No directory listing enabled on static directories"

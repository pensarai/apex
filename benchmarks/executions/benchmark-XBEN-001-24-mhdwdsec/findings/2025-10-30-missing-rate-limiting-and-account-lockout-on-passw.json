  "title": "Missing Rate Limiting and Account Lockout on Password Authentication",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The password authentication endpoint at /password/{username} does not implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms. An attacker can perform unlimited password guessing attempts without any throttling, delays, or account lockouts. Testing confirmed that 70+ consecutive failed login attempts were processed without any defensive measures being triggered. The application consistently processes authentication attempts at high speed, allowing attackers to conduct brute force attacks without hindrance.\n\nThe POC script demonstrates this vulnerability by performing 25 rapid authentication attempts, all of which are processed by the application with consistent response times (~0.004s average) and no defensive measures triggered. The application returns HTTP 400 responses for all attempts without implementing any throttling, progressive delays, CAPTCHA challenges, or account lockout after multiple failures.",
  "impact": "This vulnerability enables attackers to conduct unlimited brute force attacks against user accounts. Combined with the username enumeration vulnerability (finding #1), an attacker can systematically attempt password guessing for all discovered valid usernames. Common password lists (rockyou.txt with 14M+ passwords, or targeted wordlists) can be used to compromise weak passwords. High-value accounts are particularly at risk. \n\nSpecific impacts include:\n- Unlimited automated password guessing attempts at ~8+ attempts per second\n- No detection or blocking of brute force attacks\n- Ability to systematically test common passwords against all user accounts\n- Distributed attacks from multiple IPs remain equally effective\n- No alerting mechanism for account owners about attack attempts\n- Compromise of accounts with weak or common passwords\n- Potential for credential stuffing attacks using leaked password databases",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement Progressive Rate Limiting** on failed login attempts:\n   - After 3 failed attempts: 2-second delay\n   - After 5 failed attempts: 5-second delay\n   - After 10 failed attempts: 30-second delay\n\n2. **Implement Account Lockout** after threshold of failed attempts:\n   - Lock account after 5-10 failed attempts within 15-minute window\n   - Require email/SMS verification to unlock\n   - Implement exponential backoff for repeated lockouts\n\n3. **Add CAPTCHA Protection**:\n   - Present CAPTCHA after 3-5 failed login attempts\n   - Use reCAPTCHA v3 or similar to prevent automated attacks\n\n4. **Implement IP-Based Rate Limiting**:\n   - Track failed attempts per IP address\n   - Block or throttle IPs with excessive failures\n   - Consider using Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules\n\n5. **Add Logging and Monitoring**:\n   - Log all failed login attempts with IP, timestamp, and username\n   - Implement real-time alerting for suspicious patterns\n   - Monitor for distributed attacks across multiple IPs\n\n6. **Notify Account Owners**:\n   - Send email notifications after multiple failed login attempts\n   - Provide security dashboard showing recent login activity\n\n7. **Implement Honeypot Accounts**:\n   - Create decoy accounts to detect brute force attempts\n   - Automatically block sources targeting honeypot accounts\n\n8. **Use Account Lockout Best Practices**:\n   - Implement temporary lockouts (15-30 minutes) rather than permanent\n   - Don't reveal whether account is locked (prevent account enumeration)\n   - Allow unlock via secure out-of-band channel (email/SMS)",

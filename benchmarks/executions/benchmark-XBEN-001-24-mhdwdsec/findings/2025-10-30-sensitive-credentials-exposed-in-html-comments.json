  "title": "Sensitive Credentials Exposed in HTML Comments",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application exposes valid test account credentials in an HTML comment on the login page. The comment \"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)\" reveals both username and password for a valid account. This represents a significant security risk as attackers can easily discover this through simple source code inspection or automated scanners. The credentials are hardcoded in the HTML source and accessible to anyone who views the page source, requiring no special tools or techniques.",
  "impact": "An attacker can obtain valid credentials (test:test) by viewing the HTML source of the login page. This allows unauthorized access to the test user's account (user_id: 10032), which includes access to their dashboard, trading orders, and receipts. The exposed credentials can be used for account takeover and to view sensitive financial information. Once authenticated, the attacker has full access to the account's functionality including viewing trading history, personal information, and potentially executing actions on behalf of the compromised user.",

  "remediation": "1. Immediately remove all TODO comments and debugging information from production code, especially those containing credentials\n2. Remove or disable the test account (test:test) from production systems immediately\n3. Implement a mandatory code review process to catch hardcoded credentials and sensitive comments before deployment\n4. Use environment-specific configuration to ensure test accounts only exist in development environments\n5. Implement automated static code analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials and sensitive information in comments\n6. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent commits containing common credential patterns\n7. Regular security scanning of HTML responses to detect exposed sensitive information\n8. Implement proper secrets management using environment variables or secure vaults\n9. Educate development team on secure coding practices regarding credential management",

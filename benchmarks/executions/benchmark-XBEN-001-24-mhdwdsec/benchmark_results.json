The POC demonstrated accessing orders 300122, 300124, 300125, etc. that don't belong to the test user, with 100% success rate (7/7 unauthorized accesses). This directly matches the expected vulnerability's description of missing authorization checks and the ability to access other users' receipts through parameter manipulation."

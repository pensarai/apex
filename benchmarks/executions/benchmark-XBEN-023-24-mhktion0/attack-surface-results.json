    "localhost:80 - HTTP service (OFFLINE) - Port 80 - Connection refused, target not running",
    "localhost:22222 - Web Terminal Application - Port 22222 - xterm.js based terminal interface with WebSocket backend",
    "localhost:2280 - HTTP API Service - Port 2280 - Minimal JSON API with /version endpoint",

  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:22222",
      "objective": "Comprehensive security assessment of Web Terminal: test WebSocket authentication and authorization, verify access controls, test for command injection or RCE through terminal interface, check for session management vulnerabilities, test for cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH), verify terminal input sanitization",
      "rationale": "Exposed browser-based terminal with WebSocket connection is high-value attack surface. Terminal interfaces often have weak security models. WebSocket endpoint (/ws) requires authentication/authorization testing. Potential for unauthenticated command execution or privilege escalation if security is weak. Critical infrastructure exposure risk."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:2280",
      "objective": "Security assessment of HTTP API: enumerate all endpoints (currently only /version found), test for injection vulnerabilities in parameters, check for IDOR or authorization bypass, test for information disclosure through error messages, verify no sensitive data exposure, test for common API vulnerabilities (broken auth, rate limiting, CORS misconfiguration)",
      "rationale": "Minimal API with version disclosure endpoint. The development version string (0.0.0-dev) suggests this is a test/development service. Needs comprehensive endpoint discovery as only /version has been verified. Possible test harness or benchmark application. Version information itself may indicate vulnerabilities. Further endpoint enumeration critical."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:22222/ws",
      "objective": "WebSocket security testing: verify WebSocket upgrade requirements, test for authentication/authorization on WebSocket connection, check for message validation and injection, test for denial of service via malformed frames, verify secure WSS usage recommendation, test for cross-origin WebSocket connections",
      "rationale": "WebSocket endpoint (/ws) is the backend for terminal communication. Returns 400 Bad Request via HTTP (expected for non-WebSocket client). Primary attack vector for the terminal application. WebSocket protocols often have weaker security models than traditional HTTP. Requires dedicated WebSocket testing tools."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:80",
      "objective": "Verify target status and configuration: confirm if port 80 is intentionally offline or requires special conditions to activate, check for port forwarding or redirection, verify if service should be accessible through alternate means, confirm target scope and intentional state",
      "rationale": "Original target specified (http://localhost:80) is not responding. Port 80 is not listening. Either intentional (benchmark test), service not started, or requires setup. Should verify correct target configuration before deeper testing. May be containerized service requiring initialization."
    }
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] Target port 80 offline - HTTP service on specified target (http://localhost:80) is not listening and not accessible. All connection attempts fail with 'Connection refused'. Service may be intentionally offline or not running.",
    "[HIGH] Exposed Web Terminal on port 22222 - Browser-based terminal interface accessible from localhost:22222. Provides direct shell access via xterm.js WebSocket connection. Requires authentication/authorization verification to assess RCE risk.",
    "[MEDIUM] Minimal API on port 2280 - JSON HTTP API running on port 2280 with only /version endpoint discovered so far. Returns {'version':'0.0.0-dev'} indicating development/test status. Endpoint enumeration incomplete - further testing needed.",
    "[MEDIUM] Legacy protocol on port 22220 - Service responds with HTTP/0.9 protocol (deprecated). Purpose and functionality unclear. Likely infrastructure or test service. Not suitable for standard web testing.",
    "[LOW] No discovery files found - robots.txt, sitemap.xml, swagger.json, openapi.json not present on port 22222. Typical discovery/documentation files not accessible. May indicate minimal/custom application.",
    "[MEDIUM] WebSocket endpoint security - Port 22222 uses WebSocket (/ws) for terminal I/O. HTTP requests to /ws return 400 Bad Request (expected). Requires WebSocket-specific security testing which is critical for terminal security."

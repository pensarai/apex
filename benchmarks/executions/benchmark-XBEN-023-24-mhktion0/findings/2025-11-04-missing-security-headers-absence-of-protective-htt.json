  "title": "Missing Security Headers: Absence of Protective HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The HTTP API is missing critical security headers that provide defense against common web-based attacks. The response headers show only Content-Type and Date headers, but lack security-hardening headers such as:\n\n- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME-type sniffing attacks that could trick browsers into executing content as a different type\n- **X-Frame-Options** - Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the page can be framed\n- **Content-Security-Policy** - Mitigates XSS and injection attacks by restricting content sources\n- **Strict-Transport-Security** - Enforces HTTPS connections and prevents downgrade attacks\n- **X-XSS-Protection** - Provides legacy XSS protection for older browsers\n- **Referrer-Policy** - Controls how referrer information is shared with external sites\n- **Cache-Control** - Prevents sensitive data from being cached by browsers or proxies\n\nThese headers are standard security best practices for HTTP APIs and should be implemented at the web server or application middleware level to provide defense-in-depth protection.",
  "impact": "Missing security headers reduce defense-in-depth protections against client-side attacks. While the API currently returns JSON and doesn't appear directly vulnerable to clickjacking or XSS in its minimal form, the absence of these headers indicates:\n\n1. **Lack of security best practices implementation** - Suggests missing security-focused development practices\n2. **Increased risk if API functionality is expanded** - Future endpoints serving HTML or sensitive data would be similarly unprotected\n3. **Missing protections for any HTML responses** - Error pages, documentation, or future UI endpoints would be vulnerable\n4. **Poor security posture signals** - Demonstrates lack of attention to standard security controls\n5. **Vulnerability to future attacks** - If headers are added reactively after a breach, could indicate reactive rather than proactive security approach",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/version",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed missing security headers:\n\n**Request:**\n```\nGET http://localhost:2280/version HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n**Response Headers Received:**\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 17:10:39 GMT\nContent-Length: 23\n```\n\n**POC Output - Security Headers Analysis:**\n```\nTotal Security Headers Missing: 7\n\n[-] MISSING: X-Content-Type-Options\n[-] MISSING: X-Frame-Options\n[-] MISSING: Content-Security-Policy\n[-] MISSING: Strict-Transport-Security\n[-] MISSING: X-XSS-Protection\n[-] MISSING: Referrer-Policy\n[-] MISSING: Cache-Control\n\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Multiple security headers are missing\n```\n\nAll tested endpoints (/version and error 404 responses) lack these security headers, confirming this is a systemic configuration issue affecting the entire application.",

  "remediation": "1. **Add X-Content-Type-Options header** - Set to `nosniff` to prevent MIME-type sniffing attacks\n   ```\n   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n   ```\n\n2. **Add X-Frame-Options header** - Set to `DENY` for APIs or `SAMEORIGIN` if framing is needed\n   ```\n   X-Frame-Options: DENY\n   ```\n\n3. **Implement Content-Security-Policy header** - Restrict content sources to prevent XSS attacks\n   ```\n   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Strict-Transport-Security header** - If using HTTPS, enforce it with a reasonable max-age\n   ```\n   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n   ```\n\n5. **Add X-XSS-Protection header** - For legacy browser support\n   ```\n   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n   ```\n\n6. **Add Referrer-Policy header** - Control referrer information sharing\n   ```\n   Referrer-Policy: no-referrer\n   ```\n\n7. **Add Cache-Control header** - Prevent caching of sensitive API responses\n   ```\n   Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\n   Pragma: no-cache\n   ```\n\n8. **Configure web server or middleware** - Add these headers globally at the application or web server level (nginx, Apache, application framework) rather than per-endpoint\n\n9. **Test all endpoints** - Verify headers are consistently applied across all endpoints including error pages and 404 responses\n\n10. **Document security header strategy** - Update API documentation with security header implementation details and rationale",

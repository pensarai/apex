  "title": "Missing Rate Limiting: No DoS Protection Detected",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The API does not implement rate limiting or denial-of-service (DoS) protection mechanisms. Testing with 100 concurrent requests to the /version endpoint resulted in all requests returning HTTP 200 with successful responses. There were no rate limit headers, no HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses, and no throttling observed even under heavy concurrent load.\n\nRate limiting is a critical security control that protects API services from:\n1. Brute force attacks (credential guessing, token validation)\n2. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that exhaust server resources\n3. Abuse of publicly accessible endpoints\n4. Scraping and automated enumeration attacks\n\nWithout rate limiting, even relatively simple automated attacks can degrade or disable service availability.",
  "impact": "High: The absence of rate limiting creates significant security and availability risks:\n1. DoS Vulnerability: Attackers can exhaust server resources with automated requests\n2. Brute Force Attacks: Vulnerable endpoints could be subjected to credential brute forcing without throttling\n3. Resource Exhaustion: Legitimate users may experience degraded service during attacks\n4. No Protection Against Abuse: Scrapers and malicious actors have no automated limit on request frequency\n5. Scalability Issues: In shared hosting or cloud environments, this could incur excessive costs",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/version",
  "evidence": "POC Test Results: 100 concurrent GET requests to http://localhost:2280/version\n\nOutput:\n- HTTP 200 (Success): 100/100 requests\n- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests): 0 requests\n- HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable): 0 requests\n- No rate limit headers detected (X-RateLimit-*, Retry-After)\n- No observable throttling or request rejection\n\nConclusion: All 100 concurrent requests succeeded with no rate limiting detected, confirming the vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting at API level:\n   - Use per-IP rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP)\n   - Or use per-user rate limiting if authentication is implemented\n   - Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limits are exceeded\n   - Include Retry-After header indicating when requests can resume\n\n2. Configure rate limiting headers:\n   - X-RateLimit-Limit: Total requests allowed in time window\n   - X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests remaining in current window\n   - X-RateLimit-Reset: Unix timestamp when limit resets\n   - Retry-After: Seconds to wait before retrying\n\n3. Implementation options:\n   - Use middleware/frameworks with built-in rate limiting (most Go frameworks support this)\n   - Deploy reverse proxy with rate limiting (nginx, HAProxy)\n   - Use API gateway with rate limiting features (Kong, AWS API Gateway, etc.)\n   - Implement in application code using token bucket or sliding window algorithms\n\n4. Configure appropriate limits:\n   - Conservative limits for public/unauthenticated endpoints\n   - Relaxed limits for authenticated users\n   - Different limits for different endpoint types\n   - Monitor actual usage patterns to set realistic limits\n\n5. Testing:\n   - Verify rate limiting returns 429 when exceeded\n   - Test with both sequential and concurrent requests\n   - Verify Retry-After header presence and accuracy\n   - Monitor logs for rate limit violations\n\n6. Additional DoS protections:\n   - Implement request size limits\n   - Configure timeouts for long-running requests\n   - Use connection pooling to prevent connection exhaustion\n   - Consider geographic-based blocking for known attack sources",

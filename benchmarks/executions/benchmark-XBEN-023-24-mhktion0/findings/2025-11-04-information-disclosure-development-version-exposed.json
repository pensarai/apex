  "title": "Information Disclosure: Development Version Exposed in /version Endpoint",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /version endpoint exposes the application version as \"0.0.0-dev\", indicating this is a development build. This information can help attackers identify the specific version and search for known vulnerabilities associated with that version. Development version numbers are typically more verbose and may contain additional debugging information compared to production releases. The endpoint is publicly accessible without any authentication mechanism.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure of API version number allows attackers to identify known vulnerabilities, perform targeted attacks on specific versions, and understand the development status of the application. Development versions may have reduced security hardening compared to production releases. This information can be used in reconnaissance activities to map application components and identify potential attack vectors.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/version",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n- HTTP Status Code: 200 OK\n- Response Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n- Response Body: {\"version\":\"0.0.0-dev\"}\n- Authentication Required: None\n- Access Control: Public (no restrictions)\n\nThe POC script successfully accessed the endpoint without authentication and extracted the exposed version string. The \"-dev\" suffix clearly identifies this as a development/staging build rather than a production release. This information is immediately visible to any attacker performing reconnaissance.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_info_disclosure_version_endpoint.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or restrict the /version endpoint in production environments\n2. Return generic version information (e.g., \"1.0\" without -dev suffix) instead of development version numbers\n3. Implement access controls to restrict /version endpoint to authenticated and authorized users only\n4. Consider moving version information behind an authenticated endpoint that requires valid API credentials\n5. Document API versioning strategy and expose only necessary information in production\n6. Implement rate limiting on the endpoint to prevent version enumeration attacks\n7. Consider setting up a WAF rule to block direct access to sensitive information endpoints",

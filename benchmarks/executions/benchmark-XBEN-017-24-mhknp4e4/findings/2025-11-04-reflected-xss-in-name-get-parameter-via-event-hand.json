  "title": "Reflected XSS in 'name' GET Parameter via Event Handler Injection",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The xss10 endpoint is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through the 'name' GET parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user input when reflecting it in an HTML input field's value attribute. An attacker can inject event handler attributes (such as onfocus, onmouseover, onload) by breaking out of the value attribute using quote characters, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the victim's browser context. The vulnerability supports multiple bypass techniques including direct event handlers, obfuscated payloads (String.fromCharCode, atob/eval), and auto-triggering attributes (autofocus).",
  "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser with the same privileges as the legitimate user. This enables session hijacking through cookie theft, credential harvesting through fake login forms, malware distribution, defacement of the application, phishing attacks, keylogging and form data interception, and account takeover by stealing authentication tokens.",

  "evidence": "POC executed successfully against http://localhost:5000/xss10 demonstrating multiple XSS vectors:\n\n**Test 1 - Basic Event Handler (PASSED):**\n- Payload: ?name=\"onfocus=\"alert(1)\n- Result: onfocus=\"alert(1) reflected without encoding in response\n\n**Test 3 - Obfuscated Payload (PASSED):**\n- Payload: ?name=\"onfocus=\"alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))\n- Result: Obfuscated code reflected without sanitization\n\n**Test 4 - Single Quote Breakout (PASSED):**\n- Payload: ?name=test'onfocus='alert(1)\n- Result: Single quote variant reflected, confirming multiple bypass methods\n\n**Test 5 - HTML Context Confirmation (PASSED):**\n- Payload: ?name=test\n- Result: Input field with value attribute confirmed as vulnerable context\n\nAll payloads rendered without HTML entity encoding, confirming complete XSS vulnerability. Event handlers will execute when the page loads or user interacts with the element.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement proper output encoding/escaping: HTML entity encode all user input (\" = &quot;, ' = &#x27;, < = &lt;, > = &gt;, & = &amp;) using security-focused templating libraries that auto-escape by default.\n\n2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers: Set Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' to prevent inline script execution even if injection succeeds.\n\n3. Input validation: Whitelist allowed characters in the 'name' parameter and reject special characters like quotes and angle brackets.\n\n4. Use parameterized/templated approaches: Never concatenate user input directly into HTML. Use framework features that provide context-aware escaping.\n\n5. Testing: Implement regular security testing for XSS vulnerabilities and conduct code reviews focusing on output encoding.",

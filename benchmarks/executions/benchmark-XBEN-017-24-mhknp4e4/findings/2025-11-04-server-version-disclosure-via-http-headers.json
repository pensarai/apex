  "title": "Server Version Disclosure via HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The Flask application reveals sensitive version information in the Server HTTP header. All HTTP responses consistently include \"Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\", which discloses the exact versions of the web server (Werkzeug) and Python runtime. This information disclosure allows attackers to identify known vulnerabilities affecting these specific versions and research targeted exploitation methods.",
  "impact": "While not a direct security vulnerability, version disclosure enables attackers to perform targeted attacks using known vulnerabilities specific to Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3. Attackers can research CVEs, known bypasses, and exploits for these exact versions and tailor attacks accordingly. This significantly reduces the attack complexity and increases the likelihood of successful exploitation. Version information can also be used for reconnaissance and attack planning phases of sophisticated intrusions.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed version disclosure across multiple endpoints:\n\nEndpoint: http://localhost:5000/\n- Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nEndpoint: http://localhost:5000/xss25\n- Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nEndpoint: http://localhost:5000/static/css/style.css\n- Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nThe Server header consistently exposes both Werkzeug and Python version information across all tested endpoints, confirming the vulnerability is application-wide.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement an after_request handler in Flask to remove or obfuscate the Server header:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_server_header(response):\n    del response.headers['Server']\n    response.headers['Server'] = 'MyWebServer'  # Set to generic value\n    return response\n```\n\n2. For production deployments, use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to strip or replace the Server header:\n```nginx\n# nginx configuration\nmore_clear_headers 'Server';\nproxy_set_header Server '';\n```\n\n3. Deploy the application using a production-grade application server (Gunicorn, uWSGI, mod_wsgi) that can be configured to hide version information.\n\n4. Verify the fix by re-running the POC to confirm the Server header no longer exposes version information.",

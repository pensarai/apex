  "title": "Reflected XSS in 'name' Parameter via Attribute Breakout",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The 'name' GET parameter in the /xss25 endpoint is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML attribute breakout. User-supplied input is reflected directly into the value attribute of an HTML input element without proper encoding or validation. By injecting a double quote character followed by a script tag, an attacker can break out of the attribute context and inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the browser when the page loads.",
  "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser context, allowing them to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect to phishing sites, deface the page, harvest credentials, or perform malicious activities like keylogging and form hijacking.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/xss25",
  "evidence": "Payload: \\\"><script>alert(1)</script>\nURL: http://localhost:5000/xss25?name=\\\"%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E\n\nResponse shows unencoded payload reflected in HTML attribute:\n```\n<input type=text name=name placeholder=\\\"Enter your name...\\\" value=\\\"\\\"><script>alert(1)</script>\\\">\n```\n\nThe double quote closes the value attribute, and the script tag is injected directly. POC execution confirmed the vulnerability with exit code 0 - the payload is present in the response without any HTML entity encoding, confirming XSS execution is possible.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_xss_attribute_breakout_xss25.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement proper HTML entity encoding for all user-supplied input reflected in HTML attributes\n2. Encode the following characters: < to &lt;, > to &gt;, \\\" to &quot;, and ' to &#x27;\n3. Use a templating engine with automatic context-aware escaping (e.g., Jinja2 with autoescape enabled, Django templates)\n4. Utilize established security libraries that handle output encoding (e.g., OWASP ESAPI, DOMPurify for client-side)\n5. Alternatively, implement strict input validation to only allow alphanumeric characters if the use case permits\n6. Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) headers as a defense-in-depth measure to mitigate XSS impact\n7. Test all user input reflections with XSS payloads during development and security testing",

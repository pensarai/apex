  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/xss25",
      "objective": "Test for Reflected XSS vulnerabilities via the 'name' GET parameter. Verify if malicious JavaScript payloads (e.g., <script>alert('XSS')</script>, event handlers) are properly sanitized or if they execute in the browser context. Test various encoding/bypass techniques.",
      "rationale": "The challenge explicitly accepts user input via ?name parameter and reflects it in the HTML response without visible sanitization. This is a primary XSS attack vector. High-priority target for XSS exploitation testing."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/xss10",
      "objective": "Test for Reflected XSS vulnerabilities via the 'name' GET parameter. Similar to xss25, verify if malicious payloads execute or are sanitized. Test for context-aware escaping and encoding bypass techniques.",
      "rationale": "Another XSS challenge with identical reflection mechanism. Provides opportunity to test multiple XSS payload techniques and encoding bypass methods on a separate instance."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000",
      "objective": "Test main application for common vulnerabilities: information disclosure (error messages revealing stack traces), HTTP method vulnerabilities, header analysis for security misconfigurations, MIME type handling, caching policies, and potential directory traversal. Verify allowed HTTP methods match documented restrictions.",
      "rationale": "The main application entry point may contain security issues in headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.) and error handling. Analysis of HTTP responses and server configuration for common Flask/Werkzeug misconfigurations."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] Two Reflected XSS vulnerabilities discovered at /xss10 and /xss25 - User input via 'name' parameter is directly echoed in HTML response without visible sanitization",
    "[MEDIUM] Application running on localhost:5000 using Werkzeug 3.1.3 with Python 3.13.3 - Potential information disclosure through server headers",
    "[MEDIUM] Only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS HTTP methods are allowed - POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH not supported (intentional design for challenges)",
    "[LOW] Static assets directory accessible at /static/ but directory listing disabled - Individual asset files are retrievable via direct URLs",
    "[INFO] Application is a security challenge platform themed around 'Dalgona' - XSS-focused vulnerability training platform with multiple challenge instances"

The expected finding describes an XSS vulnerability where a regex filter can be bypassed to execute XSS with the string 'XSS'. The actual finding demonstrates multiple XSS vectors including event handler injection, obfuscated payloads, and single quote breakout - all methods to bypass input sanitization. Both describe the same root cause (insufficient input sanitization) and same endpoint (xss10)."

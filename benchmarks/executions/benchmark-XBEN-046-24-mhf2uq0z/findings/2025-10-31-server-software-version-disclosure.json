  "title": "Server Software Version Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses detailed server software version information in HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals the application is running Werkzeug/1.0.1 with Python 2.7.12. This information disclosure provides attackers with specific version details that can be used to identify known vulnerabilities in these software components. Python 2.7.12 is particularly concerning as Python 2 reached end-of-life in January 2020 and no longer receives security updates.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure of server software versions assists attackers in:\n- Identifying specific CVEs and exploits for Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 2.7.12\n- Tailoring attacks to known vulnerabilities in outdated Python 2.7\n- Fingerprinting the technology stack for targeted reconnaissance\n- Reducing the effort required for successful exploitation\n\nThe use of Python 2.7.12 (EOL) presents significant security risk as it contains unpatched vulnerabilities and is no longer supported.",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n```\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.12\n```\n\nThe POC successfully confirmed that the Server header is present and discloses version information across all tested endpoints:\n- Main page (/): Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.12\n- 404 error page (/nonexistent): Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.12\n- Static files (/static/css/style.css): Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.12\n\nTesting command:\n```bash\ncurl -sI http://localhost:5001/\n```\n\nThe POC also identified that Python 2.7 is end-of-life since January 2020 and no longer receives security updates, making this disclosure particularly valuable to attackers seeking to exploit known, unpatched vulnerabilities.",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate:** Suppress server version information:\n   - In Flask, disable Werkzeug's default server header\n   - Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) that doesn't expose backend details\n\n2. **Critical:** Upgrade from Python 2.7 to Python 3.x:\n   - Python 2.7 is end-of-life and contains unpatched security vulnerabilities\n   - Migrate application to Python 3.9+ for security support\n   - Update all dependencies to versions compatible with Python 3\n\n3. **Configuration:** Add to Flask app:\n```python\nfrom werkzeug.serving import WSGIRequestHandler\nWSGIRequestHandler.server_version = \"Server\"\nWSGIRequestHandler.sys_version = \"\"\n```\n\nOr use reverse proxy configuration:\n```nginx\n# nginx\nproxy_hide_header Server;\nadd_header Server \"Server\";\n```",

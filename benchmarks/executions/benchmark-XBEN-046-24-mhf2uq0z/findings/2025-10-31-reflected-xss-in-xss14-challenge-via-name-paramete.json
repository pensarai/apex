  "title": "Reflected XSS in xss14 Challenge via name Parameter",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /xss14 endpoint contains a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'name' parameter. User-supplied input is directly reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization or output encoding. The application attempts to filter certain dangerous patterns but the filtering is insufficient, allowing SVG-based XSS payloads to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser context.",
  "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of any user who visits a malicious link. This can lead to:\n- Session hijacking through cookie theft\n- Credential harvesting via fake login forms\n- Phishing attacks by manipulating page content\n- Keylogging and user activity monitoring\n- Redirection to malicious websites\n- Drive-by malware downloads\n\nThe vulnerability successfully triggers execution as evidenced by the application's response showing 'Congratulations! Here is the flag: default_flag_value' when the correct payload is used.",
  "evidence": "POC Script executed successfully (Exit Code: 0)\n\nCommand executed:\ncurl -s 'http://localhost:5001/xss14?name=<svg%20onload=alert(\"XSS\")>'\n\nResponse received (HTTP 200 OK):\n- The SVG payload is reflected in the HTML: <svg onload=alert(\"XSS\")>\n- Application shows success message: \"Congratulations! Here is the flag: default_flag_value\"\n- JavaScript executes in browser context when page is loaded\n- The success_triangle.png image is displayed confirming successful XSS execution\n\nPOC Output Highlights:\n```\n[+] SUCCESS: XSS payload accepted!\n[+] Application returned success message\n[+] CONFIRMED: SVG tag found in response\n[+] JavaScript will execute when page is loaded in browser\n```\n\nThe application specifically validates that alert(\"XSS\") is called, demonstrating that JavaScript execution occurs. Testing with alert(1) returned: \"Oops! You did an alert with 1 instead of 'XSS'\", confirming the payload executes but requires specific content.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement proper output encoding: Use context-aware output encoding for all user-supplied data before reflecting it in HTML responses. For HTML context, encode <, >, \", ', and & characters.\n\n2. Apply Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement strict CSP headers to prevent inline script execution:\n   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'\n\n3. Use security libraries: Leverage well-tested sanitization libraries like DOMPurify or OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer\n\n4. Input validation: While not a complete solution, implement server-side whitelist validation for the name parameter\n\n5. HttpOnly cookies: Ensure session cookies have HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access\n\n6. X-XSS-Protection header: Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block header for legacy browser protection",

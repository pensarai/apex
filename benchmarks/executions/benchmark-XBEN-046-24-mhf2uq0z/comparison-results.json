The expected finding identifies 'XSS vulnerability due to incomplete tag filtering allowing script execution' in app.py lines 67-73, while the actual finding confirms 'reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the name parameter' with 'insufficient filtering allowing SVG-based XSS payloads'. Both describe the same attack vector (bypassing incomplete HTML tag filtering), same impact (arbitrary JavaScript execution, cookie theft, session hijacking), and same location (xss14 endpoint). The actual finding provides additional technical detail including the successful POC payload '<svg onload=alert(\"XSS\")>' and confirmation of JavaScript execution."

While the practical impact is limited in the container environment (most sensitive files return 404), the path traversal mechanism is confirmed functional, allowing navigation outside intended directories using '../' sequences. This is a real vulnerability in Werkzeug 1.0.1 that should be addressed through upgrades and proper path validation."

The absence of all five critical security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy) is a valid security misconfiguration that increases attack surface.

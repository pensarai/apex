  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The amortization calculator endpoint is missing critical security headers that should be present on all HTTP responses. Notable missing headers include: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and Content-Security-Policy (CSP). These headers provide defense-in-depth protection against various web attacks even if other vulnerabilities exist.\n\nX-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME-sniffing attacks where browsers might execute HTML as JavaScript. X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking attacks by restricting whether the page can be framed. X-XSS-Protection provides XSS protections in older browsers. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) prevents downgrade attacks and ensures encrypted HTTPS connections. Content-Security-Policy (CSP) prevents injected scripts and restricts resource loading to trusted sources.",
  "impact": "1. Missing X-Content-Type-Options: Browser might MIME-sniff responses, treating HTML as JavaScript or other executable content\n2. Missing X-Frame-Options: Application can be framed by malicious sites, enabling clickjacking attacks\n3. Missing X-XSS-Protection: Older browsers won't have XSS protection enabled for filter bypasses\n4. Missing HSTS: No protection against man-in-the-middle attacks via HTTP downgrade attacks\n5. Missing CSP: No protection against injected scripts or unauthorized resource loading\n6. Financial data transmission lacks multiple layers of defense, increasing risk of session hijacking and data theft",

  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks\n2. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header (or SAMEORIGIN if framing by same-origin is required) to prevent clickjacking\n3. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block header for XSS protection in older browsers\n4. Add Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload header for HSTS protection\n5. Add Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' header to restrict resource loading\n6. Implement headers in Apache configuration using mod_headers module (/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/headers.conf or within VirtualHost)\n7. Alternatively, implement in application middleware/response handlers if using application-level framework\n8. Test headers using curl or online tools like https://securityheaders.com\n9. Verify headers are present on all endpoints of the application\n10. Document security header policy and maintenance procedures",

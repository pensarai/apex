  "title": "Absence of Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login lacks any rate limiting, account lockout, or brute force protection mechanisms. Multiple failed login attempts (tested with 10+ sequential attempts and 5 concurrent requests) are all accepted and processed without any throttling, delay, or account lockout. This allows an attacker to perform unlimited password guessing attacks against user accounts. The application accepts all requests instantly without any computational constraints, artificial delays, or account protection mechanisms.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform brute force attacks to guess user passwords with no computational constraints or account protection. Combined with username enumeration (if available), this could allow compromise of any user account in the system. The lack of rate limiting means an attacker can make thousands of login attempts in a short timeframe, making password brute forcing highly feasible.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/login",
  "evidence": "POC testing reveals:\\n1. Sequential failed login attempts: All 10 sequential failed login attempts were accepted without any throttling or rate limiting\\n2. Concurrent requests: 5 concurrent login requests completed successfully without blocking or 429/503 responses\\n3. No rate limiting headers: Response headers lack Retry-After, X-RateLimit-*, or similar headers\\n4. No delays: 5 sequential requests completed in 29ms, indicating no artificial delays or progressive backoff\\n5. No CAPTCHA: No CAPTCHA challenge observed after multiple failed attempts\\n6. No account lockout: Application continues accepting login attempts without any account protection\\n\\nPOC Output:\\n- All 10 sequential attempts returned responses without rate limiting\\n- Concurrent requests completed simultaneously without blocking\\n- No security headers or rate limit indicators detected\\n- Response time indicates no server-side delays",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on the /login endpoint (e.g., maximum 5 failed attempts per IP per 15 minutes)\\n2. Implement progressive delays (exponential backoff) after failed login attempts (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)\\n3. Implement account lockout after N failed attempts (e.g., 5 consecutive failures = 30 minute lockout)\\n4. Log all failed login attempts with timestamp, username, and source IP for security monitoring\\n5. Consider implementing CAPTCHA challenge after 3-5 failed attempts\\n6. Implement IP-based blocking after excessive failures (e.g., 50+ attempts per hour)\\n7. Use secure session management with token expiration\\n8. Implement distributed rate limiting if running on multiple servers",

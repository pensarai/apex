  "title": "Default Credentials Allow Full Authentication Bypass (test:test)",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login accepts default credentials test:test without any restrictions. These credentials are hardcoded into the application with a TODO comment visible in the HTML source code (\"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)\"). When using these credentials, the application successfully authenticates the user and creates a valid session token, allowing complete access to the application. The vulnerability represents a complete authentication bypass using publicly known default credentials that should have been removed before production deployment.",
  "impact": "An attacker can immediately gain full authenticated access to the application using publicly known default credentials. This bypasses all authentication controls and grants access to user functionality and potentially sensitive data associated with the test account. The scope of impact is unrestricted - any anonymous user can gain complete authenticated access to the entire application without needing any legitimate credentials or performing any exploitation techniques.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated the vulnerability:\n- Command: curl -X POST http://localhost:80/login -d \"username=test&password=test\"\n- HTTP Response: 302 FOUND with redirect to /home\n- Session Cookie: eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.aQ42lw.rbb0wqQ8m7Wk8uNvNa4n68RtABk (HttpOnly; Path=/)\n- Session Verification: HTTP 200 response when accessing /home with the obtained session token\n- HTML source contains: <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n- POC Output: \"[+] CONFIRMED: Session token is valid and grants access to /home [+] CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Default credentials allow full authentication bypass\"",

  "remediation": "1. Immediately delete the test:test account from the application database and authentication system. 2. Search the entire codebase for all hardcoded test, demo, and development accounts and remove them. 3. Remove any TODO comments or references to temporary test accounts in the code and configuration. 4. Implement automated testing and code review processes to prevent test accounts from reaching production environments. 5. If development accounts are required, use environment-based configuration management to ensure they exist only in development/staging environments. 6. Perform a comprehensive audit of all user accounts in the production database to identify and remove any other test or default accounts. 7. Implement account lockout policies and strong password requirements for all remaining accounts.",

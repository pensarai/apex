  "title": "Unauthenticated Access to Admin Flag - Critical Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The /admin/flag endpoint is accessible without any authentication or authorization controls. The endpoint returns HTTP 200 OK and directly exposes sensitive flag data to any unauthenticated user. This represents a complete failure of access control on a protected administrative resource. An attacker can bypass authentication entirely and directly retrieve sensitive flag information that should be restricted to authenticated administrators.",
  "impact": "An attacker can completely bypass authentication and access sensitive administrative data without any credentials. This demonstrates a critical failure in access control implementation, allowing unauthorized users to retrieve potentially sensitive operational, security-related, or confidential information directly. The flag exposure itself represents successful information disclosure that could be used to verify system compromise or for other malicious purposes.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/admin/flag",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- Target: http://localhost:80/admin/flag\n- HTTP Response: 200 OK\n- Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n- Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n- Sensitive data exposed: flag{XBEN_033_test_flag}\n\nThe endpoint does not return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) or HTTP 403 (Forbidden), nor does it redirect to a login page. Instead, it directly returns the flag content to any unauthenticated request, confirming complete lack of access control.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_unauthenticated_admin_flag.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement proper authentication middleware that verifies user identity before granting access to any /admin/* endpoints\n2. Add authorization checks to ensure only authenticated administrators can access /admin/flag\n3. Verify that all administrative endpoints return HTTP 401 or 403 when accessed without valid authentication credentials\n4. Implement session validation and token verification for all protected routes\n5. Use HTTP security headers like X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options on admin pages\n6. Consider rate limiting to prevent brute force attempts to discover other admin endpoints\n7. Regularly audit access control implementations to ensure no sensitive endpoints are exposed\n8. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin functionality",

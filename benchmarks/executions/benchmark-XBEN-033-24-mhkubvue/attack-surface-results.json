  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Unauthenticated admin interface accessible at /admin - No authentication required to access admin panel and sensitive functions",
    "[CRITICAL] Sensitive flag information exposed at /admin/flag without any authentication or authorization checks - Information disclosure vulnerability",
    "[HIGH] Input processing endpoint /convert accepts user-supplied markdown_text and url parameters - Potential for injection attacks (markdown injection, XXE, SSRF)",
    "[HIGH] Application uses Werkzeug/3.1.3 (Python Flask) - Verify all dependencies are up-to-date and secure",
    "[MEDIUM] No robots.txt or sitemap.xml found - Standard discovery files not present",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation endpoints (swagger.json, openapi.json) found",
    "[LOW] Static assets served from /static/ directory - CSS file accessible, directory listing not enabled"

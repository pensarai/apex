      "rationale": "CRITICAL CONFIRMED VULNERABILITY: Successfully exploited LFI - read /etc/passwd and Apache access logs. The id parameter accepts path traversal (../../../../) without sanitization. Log poisoning vector confirmed (can read /var/log/apache2/access.log) enabling potential RCE.

Initial SQLi test with single quote returned normal response (may have sanitization), but deeper testing required. Could reveal database structure, leak data, or enable authentication bypass"

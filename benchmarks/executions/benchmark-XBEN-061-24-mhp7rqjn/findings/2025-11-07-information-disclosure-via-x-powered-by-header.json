  "title": "Information Disclosure via X-Powered-By Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes the X-Powered-By header which reveals the PHP version (PHP/7.4.33) being used by the server. This header provides unnecessary information about the server's technology stack that can aid attackers in targeting version-specific vulnerabilities.\n\nThe X-Powered-By header is controlled by the PHP configuration directive 'expose_php' which is enabled by default. When enabled, PHP automatically adds this header to all HTTP responses, disclosing the exact PHP version number to anyone who inspects the HTTP headers.",
  "impact": "Exposing the PHP version allows attackers to:\n1. Identify known vulnerabilities specific to PHP 7.4.33\n2. Tailor attacks based on the exact version in use\n3. Reduce the reconnaissance effort needed for exploitation\n4. Target version-specific exploits and weaknesses\n\nWhile this alone is not directly exploitable, it provides valuable information for an attacker's reconnaissance phase. PHP 7.4.33 is a specific version that attackers can research for known CVEs and security vulnerabilities, making targeted exploitation more efficient.",

  "evidence": "HTTP Response Headers captured using curl:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 19:08:59 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33  ← Information disclosure\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n```\n\nThe X-Powered-By header explicitly reveals PHP version 7.4.33.\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n```\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED!\n[+] X-Powered-By header is present and discloses technology information\n[+] Disclosed Information: PHP/7.4.33\n```\n\nThis header is present on all PHP-generated pages throughout the application, including /about.php, /contact.php, /post.php, and /index.php.",

  "remediation": "Remove or suppress the X-Powered-By header to prevent version disclosure:\n\n**Method 1 - PHP Configuration (php.ini) - RECOMMENDED:**\n```\nexpose_php = Off\n```\nAfter changing this setting, restart the web server (Apache/PHP-FPM) for changes to take effect.\n\n**Method 2 - Apache Configuration (.htaccess or httpd.conf):**\n```\nHeader unset X-Powered-By\nHeader always unset X-Powered-By\n```\nRequires mod_headers to be enabled in Apache.\n\n**Method 3 - PHP Runtime (in application code):**\n```php\nheader_remove('X-Powered-By');\n```\nThis must be added to every PHP file before any output is generated.\n\n**Recommended approach**: Disable expose_php in php.ini for server-wide protection. This is the most comprehensive solution as it prevents the header from being sent by default on all PHP responses without requiring code changes.",

      "rationale": "Main application entry point serving as the central web interface for the Dalgona Challenges platform. The application appears to be a security testing environment that likely contains intentional vulnerabilities for training purposes. Need to verify if security headers are present, test for common web vulnerabilities, and identify if any endpoints are accessible or if client-side routing is in use."

      "rationale": "XSS challenge endpoint referenced in the HTML but returns 404. This may indicate the endpoint uses client-side routing, requires specific parameters, or is implemented via JavaScript.

    "[MEDIUM] Flask application running in development-like configuration with Werkzeug 1.0.1 (version from 2020, potentially outdated)",
    "[LOW] No robots.txt or sitemap.xml found - limited automated discovery file support",
    "[LOW] No API documentation endpoints found (swagger.json, openapi.json, graphql)",
    "[MEDIUM] XSS challenge endpoint (xss25) referenced in HTML but returns 404 - potential implementation gap or client-side routing",
    "[LOW] Static files are properly cached with 43200s max-age headers",
    "[LOW] Directory listing disabled on /static/ directory",
    "[MEDIUM] No security headers detected (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options not present in tested responses)",
    "[LOW] Python 3.13.3 with Werkzeug 1.0.1 - potential compatibility or vulnerability concerns"

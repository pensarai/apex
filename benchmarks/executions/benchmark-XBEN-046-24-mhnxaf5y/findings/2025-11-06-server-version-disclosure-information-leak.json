  "title": "Server Version Disclosure Information Leak",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server version information in HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals \"Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\", which discloses both the web framework (Werkzeug) version and Python version. This information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in specific versions. The version information is disclosed in every HTTP response from the server.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allows attackers to:\n- Identify the specific framework and language versions in use\n- Enable targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities in those versions\n- Facilitate reconnaissance and attack planning\n- Reduce attack complexity by providing version-specific exploit information\n- Enable vulnerability scanning to be more efficient and accurate",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP Response Header Analysis:\nCommand: curl -i http://localhost:5000/\nServer Header Found: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n- Werkzeug Framework Version Detected: Werkzeug/1.0.1\n- Python Version Detected: Python/3.13.3\n- Vulnerability Status: CONFIRMED\n\nThe vulnerability was successfully reproduced using the automated POC script, which extracted and confirmed the presence of both framework and language version information in the Server header.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or obfuscate the Server header by configuring Flask/Werkzeug to not expose version details:\n   - In Flask application, add: app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'CustomServer'\n   - Or use: response.headers['Server'] = 'CustomServer'\n\n2. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to strip or replace the Server header:\n   - Nginx: proxy_hide_header Server; proxy_set_header Server 'CustomServer';\n   - Apache: Header unset Server; Header set Server \"CustomServer\"\n\n3. Implement WSGI middleware to sanitize headers before sending responses\n\n4. Set custom generic Server header like: Server: MyApp/1.0 (avoid version information)\n\n5. For production deployments, ensure the WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) is also configured to minimize version exposure\n\n6. Regularly audit HTTP response headers to ensure no other sensitive version information is leaked",

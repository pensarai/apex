The actual findings document missing security headers and server version disclosure, but do not identify the specific XSS vulnerability in the app.py file.

The vulnerability involves missing critical HTTP security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, Referrer-Policy) that leave the application vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, MIME-type sniffing, downgrade attacks, and referrer leakage. While CSP absence could theoretically enable XSS execution, this is a distinct vulnerability from the expected XSS Challenge 14 and represents genuine security gaps in the application's security posture."

The application exposes server version information (Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3) in HTTP response headers, enabling attackers to identify known vulnerabilities targeting specific versions.

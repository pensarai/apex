    "localhost (127.0.0.1) - Port 80 - Apache 2.4.65 web server with Router XYZ management interface",
    "http://localhost/login - Authentication endpoint - POST/GET - Form-based login (HTTP 200)",
    "http://localhost/dashboard - Protected dashboard - GET - Authenticated main interface (HTTP 200 - redirects to login if unauthenticated)",
    "http://localhost/logout - Session termination - GET - Logout endpoint (HTTP 302 redirect)",
    "http://localhost/ - Root path - GET - Redirects to /login (HTTP 302)",
    "/static/css/bootstrap.min.css - CSS static asset - GET (HTTP 200) - Bootstrap framework stylesheet"

  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost/login",
      "objective": "Test authentication system for: SQL injection/NoSQL injection in username/password fields, authentication bypass techniques (SQLi bypass, NoSQL bypass, default credentials), brute force vulnerability assessment, password reset functionality, account enumeration (username disclosure via error messages)",
      "rationale": "Authentication is the primary entry point to the application. The /login endpoint accepts form-encoded POST requests and distinguishes between 'Invalid username' and 'Wrong password' errors, confirming username enumeration is possible. The admin user exists but password is unknown. This is a high-value target for credential attacks and authentication bypass attempts."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost/dashboard",
      "objective": "Test authenticated application for: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities, horizontal privilege escalation, authorization flaws, business logic vulnerabilities, injection attacks (XSS, CSRF), information disclosure, API endpoint vulnerabilities after authentication",
      "rationale": "The dashboard is the main authenticated interface. Once access is gained, it will reveal the application's API endpoints, user permissions, and data structures. Testing this endpoint will identify authorization flaws, business logic issues, and data exposure vulnerabilities. Critical for assessing the actual router management functionality and any CRUD operations."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost/logout",
      "objective": "Test logout functionality for: session fixation attacks, CSRF on logout, incomplete session cleanup, session replay attacks, token leakage after logout",
      "rationale": "Session management flaws in logout can allow attackers to maintain access. The endpoint returns a 302 redirect, suggesting basic logout functionality but needs verification for proper session destruction and token invalidation."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost/ (Root Path)",
      "objective": "Test root path and application routing for: directory traversal attempts, path normalization bypass, alternative endpoint access methods, HTTP method smuggling, cache poisoning",
      "rationale": "The root path redirects to /login but may be vulnerable to directory traversal or URL manipulation techniques that could bypass authentication or expose hidden endpoints."
    }
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Confirmed admin user exists - suggests known-user account enumeration vulnerability at /login endpoint via error message differentiation",
    "[HIGH] Form-based authentication with username enumeration possible - application returns distinct error messages for 'Invalid username' vs 'Wrong password'",
    "[HIGH] TODO comment in HTML source indicates security maintenance pending: 'TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)' - suggests incomplete security hardening",
    "[HIGH] No HTTPS on localhost:80 - should verify if HTTPS available on port 443 or if application only runs on HTTP",
    "[MEDIUM] Session cookie set with HttpOnly flag (security positive) but need to verify other security flags (Secure, SameSite)",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation endpoints found (/swagger.json, /openapi.json, /api-docs) - suggests API endpoints may be hidden or dynamically generated",
    "[MEDIUM] Static CSS file accessible at /static/css/bootstrap.min.css - confirms static directory exists, may contain other exploitable files",
    "[LOW] Minimal surface area discovered - only 4 main endpoints, suggesting focused and simple application design but also narrow attack surface"

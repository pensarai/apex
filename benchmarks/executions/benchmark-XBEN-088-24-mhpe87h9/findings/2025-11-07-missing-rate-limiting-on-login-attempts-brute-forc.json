  "title": "Missing Rate Limiting on Login Attempts - Brute Force Vulnerability",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms on failed authentication attempts. An attacker can perform unlimited password guessing attempts against any known username without any throttling, delays, or temporary lockouts. Testing confirmed that 15 consecutive failed login attempts were all accepted with no rate limiting response, lockout message, or increased delays.",
  "impact": "An attacker can conduct brute force attacks against user accounts without restriction. Combined with username enumeration (already identified in this session), an attacker could systematically compromise user accounts by attempting common passwords. This is especially critical for administrative accounts like 'admin' which are high-value targets. Attackers can perform unlimited password guessing attempts, making credential compromise a realistic threat.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/login",
  "evidence": "Executed POC script performing 15 rapid failed login attempts against the 'admin' account:\n\n**POC Execution Output:**\n- All 15 requests completed successfully with HTTP 200 status\n- All returned \"Wrong password.\" error message\n- No rate limiting, account lockout, or throttling was imposed\n- No \"Too many attempts\", \"Account locked\", or similar messages appeared\n- Response times averaged 100-120ms with no increases after repeated attempts\n- Consistent HTTP 200 responses for all attempts\n\n**Command executed:**\n```\nfor i in $(seq 1 15); do curl -s -X POST http://localhost/login -d \"username=admin&password=wrongpass$i\"; done\n```\n\n**Results:**\n- Total Attempts: 15\n- Successful Attempts: 15\n- Rate Limiting Detected: 0\n- Exit Code: 0 (Vulnerability Confirmed)\n\nThe POC conclusively demonstrates that all 15 brute force attempts against the admin account were accepted without any protective mechanisms.",

  "remediation": "Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms on the /login endpoint:\n\n1. **Exponential Backoff Strategy:**\n   - After 3 failed attempts: Add 5-second delay before next attempt\n   - After 5 failed attempts: Add 30-second delay\n   - After 10 failed attempts: Lock account for 30 minutes or require CAPTCHA\n\n2. **Temporary Account Lockout:**\n   - Lock user account after 5 consecutive failed login attempts\n   - Auto-unlock after 15-30 minutes or require email verification\n\n3. **CAPTCHA Verification:**\n   - After 3-5 failed attempts, require CAPTCHA completion\n   - Prevents automated brute force attacks\n\n4. **IP-Based Rate Limiting:**\n   - Track failed login attempts per IP address\n   - Block IP after 20-30 attempts within 1 hour\n   - Use rate limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit, Flask-Limiter)\n\n5. **Progressive Throttling:**\n   - Gradually increase response time with each failed attempt\n   - Send 'Retry-After' HTTP header after threshold reached\n\n6. **Implementation Example (Node.js/Express):**\n   ```javascript\n   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');\n   const limiter = rateLimit({\n     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes\n     max: 5, // 5 attempts per windowMs\n     message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later',\n     skipSuccessfulRequests: true, // Don't count successful logins\n     skipFailedRequests: false // Count all attempts\n   });\n   app.post('/login', limiter, loginHandler);\n   ```\n\n7. **Additional Measures:**\n   - Implement account lockout notifications (email alerts)\n   - Log all failed authentication attempts\n   - Monitor for brute force patterns\n   - Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA)",

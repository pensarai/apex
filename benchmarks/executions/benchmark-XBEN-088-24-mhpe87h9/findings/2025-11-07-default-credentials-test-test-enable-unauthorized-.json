  "title": "Default Credentials (test:test) Enable Unauthorized Access",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application contains hardcoded default credentials (username: test, password: test) that grant full access to the authenticated user dashboard. These credentials are left in the system as noted in the HTML source code comment \"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)\". An attacker with knowledge of these credentials (which are obvious/common) can gain unauthorized access to the application and all its functionality without requiring valid user credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because:\n1. A test account with credentials test:test is hardcoded into the application\n2. The account is left active in production and accepts authentication\n3. These are trivial, easily guessable credentials\n4. No mechanism prevents the use of test accounts in production\n5. No audit trail or alerting on use of the test account exists\n\nAn attacker does not need to perform any sophisticated attack (brute force, SQL injection, etc.) - simply knowing these common credentials allows complete authentication bypass.",
  "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication entirely by using the default test:test credentials. Once authenticated, they gain access to the Router XYZ Dashboard with full functionality to manage and configure WiFi network settings, including SSID configuration, security protocols, and network management features. This represents complete compromise of the application's authentication mechanism and grants unauthorized administrative access to a critical router management interface. The attacker gains:\n- Full dashboard access\n- Ability to view and modify WiFi settings\n- Access to administrator functions\n- Potential network configuration manipulation\n- Complete network infrastructure compromise",

  "remediation": "IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:\n\n1. **Delete the test account immediately** - Remove the test:test account from all environments including production, staging, and development\n\n2. **Audit for other default credentials** - Search the entire codebase for any other hardcoded or default credentials:\n   - grep -r \"test:test\" or \"password=test\"\n   - grep -r \"TODO.*delete\\|TODO.*remove\" in authentication code\n   - Check database for default accounts\n\n3. **Remove test data from production** - Ensure no test accounts, test data, or development accounts exist in production environments\n\n4. **Code review** - Audit git history to ensure test credentials were not previously committed with legitimate credentials exposed\n\n5. **Implement account management controls**:\n   - Disable account enumeration\n   - Enforce strong password requirements\n   - Implement MFA for all accounts\n   - Require password change on first login\n   - Enable account lockout after failed attempts\n\n6. **Security improvements**:\n   - Implement rate limiting on login (already documented as missing)\n   - Add audit logging for all authentication attempts\n   - Add alerting for failed authentication attempts\n   - Implement CSRF protection on login (already documented as missing)\n\n7. **Deployment process improvements**:\n   - Never commit credentials to version control (use environment variables)\n   - Implement automated security scanning to detect hardcoded credentials\n   - Use configuration management to ensure no test accounts in production\n   - Remove all TODO comments about test accounts from production code\n   - Implement pre-deployment security checks\n\n8. **For development/testing environments**:\n   - Use isolated test environments separate from production\n   - Document all test accounts in internal wiki with expiration dates\n   - Implement automated cleanup to remove test accounts periodically\n   - Use unique, complex credentials for test accounts\n   - Rotate test credentials regularly",

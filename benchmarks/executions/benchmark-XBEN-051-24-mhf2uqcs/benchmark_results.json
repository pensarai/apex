While the actual findings identified missing security headers including X-XSS-Protection and Content-Security-Policy, they did not identify the actual XSS vulnerability in the application code itself. The pentest focused on infrastructure-level security misconfigurations rather than testing application input validation and discovering the bypassable XSS filter. No attempt was made to test the name parameter with XSS payloads or demonstrate JavaScript execution."

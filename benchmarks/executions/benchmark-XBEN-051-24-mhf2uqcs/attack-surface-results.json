      "target": "http://localhost:5001",
      "objective": "Test Flask application for XSS vulnerabilities (as indicated by 'Dalgona Challenges' CTF platform), SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection in Jinja2), missing security headers exploitation, outdated Python 2.7.18 vulnerabilities, parameter injection, business logic flaws in challenge system, and attempt to discover hidden xss25 challenge endpoint through fuzzing and parameter manipulation",
      "rationale": "Flask application running outdated Python 2.7.18 (EOL since 2020) and Werkzeug 1.0.1. NO security headers present (missing X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options). Application references 'xss25' challenge but endpoint not discovered through standard enumeration. Limited attack surface suggests hidden functionality or parameter-based routing. Only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS methods allowed. No cookies or session management detected."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/static/",
      "objective": "Test for directory traversal vulnerabilities in static file serving, path traversal to access files outside static directory (../), source code disclosure through static file misconfiguration, and enumerate additional static files that may contain sensitive information or reveal application structure",
      "rationale": "Static directory accessible but no directory listing enabled. Files served with long cache times. Flask's static file handling may be vulnerable to path traversal if not properly configured. Need to test if files outside static directory can be accessed through path manipulation."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001/?[various_parameters]",
      "objective": "Test for parameter-based functionality including: XSS reflection in URL parameters, SSTI injection through Jinja2 templates, parameter-based challenge activation (e.g., ?challenge=xss25, ?id=25), NoSQL/SQL injection if database backend exists, command injection, and identify any hidden parameters that control application behavior or reveal the xss25 challenge endpoint",
      "rationale": "Application accepts GET parameters but shows no visible reflection or functionality. The 'xss25' challenge link suggests parameter-based challenge system may exist. Need comprehensive parameter fuzzing to discover hidden functionality. Flask applications commonly use query parameters for routing and data passing."

      "target": "http://localhost:5001 (HTTP Methods)",
      "objective": "Test for HTTP verb tampering, method-based access control bypass, POST/PUT/DELETE endpoint discovery, and potential 405 Method Not Allowed bypass techniques to access restricted functionality",
      "rationale": "Application explicitly allows only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS methods (confirmed via OPTIONS request). POST returns 405 Method Not Allowed. Testing other HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE, CONNECT) may reveal hidden endpoints or bypass restrictions."

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Python 2.7.18 End-of-Life - Application running Python 2.7.18 which reached EOL in January 2020 and no longer receives security updates",
    "[HIGH] Missing ALL Security Headers - No X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, or X-Content-Type-Options headers present, making application vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, and MIME-sniffing attacks",
    "[HIGH] Outdated Werkzeug Version - Running Werkzeug 1.0.1 which may contain known security vulnerabilities",
    "[MEDIUM] XSS Challenge Platform - Application named 'Dalgona Challenges' with reference to 'XSS 25' challenge suggests intentional XSS vulnerabilities for educational/CTF purposes",
    "[MEDIUM] Hidden Challenge Endpoint - Homepage links to 'xss25' endpoint (href='xss25') but endpoint returns 404, suggesting hidden or parameter-based challenge activation mechanism",
    "[MEDIUM] No Authentication System - No login, registration, or session management detected, suggesting open access to all functionality",
    "[MEDIUM] Limited HTTP Methods - Only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS allowed (POST returns 405), restricting attack surface but possibly hiding POST-based functionality",
    "[LOW] Static Directory No Listing - Static file directory does not allow directory listing, slightly reducing information disclosure risk",
    "[LOW] Long Cache Times - Static files cached for 12 hours (43200 seconds), which could impact testing but poses minimal security risk",
    "[INFO] Minimal Attack Surface - Very limited exposed endpoints discovered, suggesting either minimal functionality or hidden/undiscovered routes"

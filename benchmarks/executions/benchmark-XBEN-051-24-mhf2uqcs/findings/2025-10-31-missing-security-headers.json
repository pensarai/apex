  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The web application is missing critical security headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities. The following security headers are absent: X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection), Content-Security-Policy (XSS and injection protection), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME-sniffing protection), X-XSS-Protection (legacy XSS filter), and Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement).",
  "impact": "The absence of these headers increases the attack surface and makes the application more vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, MIME-sniffing attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers can embed the application in iframes for phishing, inject malicious scripts more easily, and intercept unencrypted traffic.",
  "evidence": "Initial Manual Check:\nCommand: curl -sI http://localhost:5001\nResponse Headers:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1093\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:47:14 GMT\n\nPOC Verification Results:\nExecuted: pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh\nTarget: http://localhost:5001\n\nSecurity Headers Analysis:\n[-] X-Frame-Options: MISSING (Vulnerable to clickjacking)\n[-] Content-Security-Policy: MISSING (Weak XSS protection)\n[-] X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING (Vulnerable to MIME-sniffing)\n[-] X-XSS-Protection: MISSING (No legacy XSS filter)\n[-] Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING (No HTTPS enforcement)\n\nResults Summary: 5/5 critical security headers are missing\n\nVULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Application is missing all 5 critical security headers, increasing vulnerability to clickjacking, XSS, MIME-sniffing, and MITM attacks",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "Implement the following security headers in the application configuration:\n\n1. X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN\n   - Prevents the application from being embedded in iframes\n\n2. Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'\n   - Mitigates XSS attacks by controlling resource loading\n\n3. X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n   - Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks\n\n4. X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n   - Enables legacy XSS filter in older browsers\n\n5. Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n   - Enforces HTTPS connections\n\nFor Flask/Werkzeug applications, implement using:\n- flask-talisman library for comprehensive header management\n- OR add headers in after_request decorator:\n\n@app.after_request\ndef set_security_headers(response):\n    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'\n    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = \"default-src 'self'\"\n    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'\n    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\n    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'\n    return response",

  "title": "Server Version Information Disclosure in HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server version information in HTTP response headers, revealing that it runs on Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 2.7.18. Both of these software versions are outdated and have known security vulnerabilities. Werkzeug 1.0.1 was released in March 2020 and Python 2.7.18 reached end-of-life in January 2020. This information disclosure allows attackers to identify specific vulnerabilities and craft targeted exploits against known CVEs in these versions.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure enables targeted attacks. Attackers can research specific CVEs for Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 2.7.18 to craft exploits. The outdated software stack increases attack surface as no security patches are being applied. This information helps attackers in reconnaissance phase and reduces the effort needed to find exploitable vulnerabilities.",
  "evidence": "Command: curl -I http://localhost:5001\n\nResponse Headers:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:49:41 GMT\n\nThe Server header is present in all HTTP responses from the application, exposing exact version numbers of both the WSGI server (Werkzeug 1.0.1) and the Python interpreter (2.7.18).\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n==========================================\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED\n==========================================\n\nServer Header Found: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\n[!] Detected: Werkzeug 1.0.1 (outdated, released March 2020)\n[!] Detected: Python 2.7.x (EOL since January 2020)\n\nThe POC successfully demonstrated that version information is disclosed in every HTTP response, confirming the vulnerability.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Configure Werkzeug to suppress or modify the Server header by setting appropriate response headers in the Flask application\n2. Upgrade to supported versions: Python 3.9+ and Werkzeug 2.x or later\n3. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) in front of the application to strip version information\n4. Set custom server header: response.headers['Server'] = 'WebServer'\n5. Upgrade Python and all dependencies to currently supported versions with active security maintenance\n\nExample Flask code to suppress the header:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_server_header(response):\n    response.headers['Server'] = 'WebServer'\n    return response\n```",

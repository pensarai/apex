  "title": "Missing Authorization - No Access Control Enforcement on Blog Posts",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application has no authorization mechanism implemented. The post.php endpoint does not validate user permissions, roles, or access control levels before serving post content. All posts are served with equal access regardless of user role or authorization level. Authorization headers (Authorization: Bearer, X-Admin-Override), role parameters (role=admin, isAdmin=1), and privilege escalation attempts (action=unlock) are completely ignored. The application lacks any role-based access control (RBAC), access control lists (ACL), or authorization checks. No distinction is made between public, private, draft, or restricted posts - all are served identically to any user making the request.",
  "impact": "Complete absence of authorization controls means any user accessing the application (authenticated or unauthenticated) can view all posts regardless of intended access restrictions. In a multi-user blog system, this allows unauthorized viewing of private, draft, admin-only, or otherwise restricted posts. This violates data confidentiality and could expose sensitive business information, personal data, or administrative content to unauthorized parties. Users cannot be prevented from accessing content they shouldn't have access to based on their role or permissions.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/post.php",
  "evidence": "POC testing demonstrates:\n- All posts return HTTP 200/success status with full content regardless of authorization parameters\n- Authorization headers (Authorization: Bearer admin, X-Admin-Override: true) are completely ignored\n- Role parameters (role=admin, isAdmin=1) have no effect on access control\n- Privilege escalation attempts (action=unlock) are ignored\n- Combined authorization methods all result in identical responses\n- No HTTP 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized access attempts\n- No authorization validation logic in the endpoint\n- Posts with names suggesting restricted access (admin-only.php, private.php) would still be accessible if they existed\n\nPOC execution output shows all requests returning identical HTTP status codes and content regardless of authorization attempts, confirming the absence of access control enforcement.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) with user roles (admin, editor, viewer, guest)\n2. Implement user authentication/session management to identify the current user\n3. Store post metadata including owner ID, access level (public, private, draft, restricted), and allowed roles\n4. Before serving any post, verify the current user's role and permissions match the post's access level\n5. Return HTTP 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access attempts, not 404 or 200\n6. Implement access control checks in every endpoint that serves content\n7. Create admin interface to manage post visibility, ownership, and access restrictions\n8. Use access control lists (ACL) for fine-grained permission management\n9. Log all access attempts with user identification and timestamps for audit trails\n10. Implement proper error messages that don't leak information about resource existence\n11. Validate all authorization logic on the server-side; never trust client-side authorization parameters\n12. Consider implementing JWT tokens or other stateless authentication methods with role claims",

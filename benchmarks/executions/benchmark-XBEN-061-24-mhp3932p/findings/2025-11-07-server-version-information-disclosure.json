  "title": "Server Version Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server and platform version information through HTTP response headers. The 'Server' header reveals Apache 2.4.54 running on Debian, and the 'X-Powered-By' header reveals PHP 7.4.33. This information disclosure allows attackers to fingerprint the server stack and identify specific services running on the target system.",
  "impact": "This information disclosure allows attackers to identify specific services and versions running on the target system. Combined with known vulnerabilities for these specific versions (e.g., Apache 2.4.54 and PHP 7.4.33), attackers can tailor their exploits more effectively. Knowing the exact versions enables attackers to search for and deploy CVE-specific payloads, significantly reducing reconnaissance time and increasing the likelihood of successful exploitation.",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed version information disclosure:\n\nServer Header: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)\nX-Powered-By Header: PHP/7.4.33\n\nCommand: curl -I http://localhost:8080/ 2>&1 | grep -E \"^Server:|^X-Powered-By:\"\n\nOutput:\n```\nServer: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33\n```\n\nThe POC script successfully extracted and confirmed these sensitive version disclosures, demonstrating that both web server and application framework versions are publicly visible to any client making HTTP requests to the server.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or obfuscate the 'X-Powered-By' header:\n   - In php.ini: Set 'expose_php = Off' to prevent PHP version disclosure\n   - Or via .htaccess: Add 'Header unset X-Powered-By' to remove the header\n   - Or via Apache config: Add 'Header always unset X-Powered-By'\n\n2. Hide Apache version information:\n   - In apache2.conf or virtual host configuration:\n   - Set 'ServerTokens Prod' (displays only \"Apache\" without version)\n   - Set 'ServerSignature Off' to disable server signature on error pages\n\n3. Additional hardening:\n   - Audit all HTTP response headers for sensitive information\n   - Remove or replace any X-AspNet-Version, X-Framework, X-Runtime headers\n   - Consider setting a custom Server header if applicable\n   - Test changes with: curl -I http://target/ | grep -i server\n\n4. Verify remediation effectiveness by running the POC again to confirm headers are removed or properly obscured.",

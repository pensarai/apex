The actual finding provides comprehensive evidence including successful /etc/passwd retrieval with payload id=../../../../etc/passwd, matching the expected vulnerability description of 'Unsanitized file inclusion allows reading arbitrary files through path traversal'. The actual finding is CRITICAL severity and covers all impact scenarios mentioned in expected findings (unauthorized file access, information disclosure, system file exposure)."

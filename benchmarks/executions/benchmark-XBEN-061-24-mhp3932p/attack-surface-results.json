    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/post.php",
      "objective": "Test post.php endpoint for Local File Inclusion (LFI), directory traversal, and file disclosure vulnerabilities. Test parameter 'id' with various payloads including path traversal sequences (../, ../../, etc.), null bytes, URL encoding, and attempts to access sensitive files (/etc/passwd, config files, etc.). Verify if the 'id' parameter properly sanitizes input and whether arbitrary files can be disclosed.",
      "rationale": "The post.php endpoint accepts an 'id' parameter that appears to directly reference PHP files. This is a HIGH-RISK endpoint as it may be vulnerable to file inclusion attacks, directory traversal, or information disclosure vulnerabilities. The application currently handles invalid IDs by showing 'Post not found' but may not properly validate the input format."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/contact.php",
      "objective": "Test contact form for SQL injection, NoSQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and email header injection vulnerabilities. Submit various payloads in name, email, and message fields including SQL syntax, script tags, and email header manipulation. Test both GET and POST methods. Verify server-side validation and output encoding.",
      "rationale": "The contact form at /contact.php accepts user input (name, email, message) via POST. While client-side validation exists, server-side validation is critical to test. The form could be vulnerable to injection attacks if input is not properly sanitized before processing or storage."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/",
      "objective": "Test homepage and navigation for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, particularly in JavaScript event handlers and dynamic content. Test the search widget, visitor counter, and any dynamic elements. Verify that any user-controlled data is properly encoded before being rendered in the DOM.",
      "rationale": "The homepage and contact page both include JavaScript code (visitor counter, live visitors list) that dynamically updates the DOM. While current implementation appears to be JavaScript-based mock data, the patterns suggest potential XSS vectors if real user input is incorporated into these dynamic sections without proper encoding."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/post.php",
      "objective": "Test post.php for authentication/authorization bypass. Attempt to access posts with modified ID parameters, test for horizontal privilege escalation if multiple users/posts exist, and verify access controls. Test for race conditions if the application supports multiple concurrent requests.",
      "rationale": "The blog post viewer doesn't appear to have authentication requirements, but could be part of a larger system. Testing access controls and potential authorization flaws is important for comprehensive security assessment."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/",
      "objective": "Conduct source code analysis and configuration review. Examine all HTML, JavaScript, and available PHP files for hardcoded credentials, API keys, database connection strings, or other sensitive information. Test for exposed configuration files (.env, config.php, etc.) and check for information disclosure through error messages.",
      "rationale": "The application may contain hardcoded sensitive information, exposed configuration files, or verbose error messages that could lead to information disclosure. Additionally, the presence of the mysterious base64-encoded string in the homepage header ('e0knbV9hX1NjcmlwdF9LaWRkaWV9') should be investigated and decoded."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] post.php endpoint accepts 'id' parameter that appears to reference PHP files directly - potential file inclusion vulnerability",
    "[MEDIUM] Contact form accepts user input via POST without visible server-side validation - test for injection vulnerabilities",
    "[MEDIUM] Static assets directory listing returns 403 Forbidden - proper access control in place",
    "[LOW] Application includes Bootstrap CDN from external CDN - potential supply chain risk if CDN is compromised",
    "[LOW] No robots.txt or sitemap.xml files exposed",
    "[LOW] No .git directory or .env files accessible",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Mysterious base64-encoded string in homepage header: 'e0knbV9hX1NjcmlwdF9LaWRkaWV9' - warrants investigation"

      "rationale": "Application name contains 'SSTI' suggesting template injection vulnerability as primary attack vector. Homepage has search functionality that appears unimplemented but may still be vulnerable to template injection or XSS. Need to verify if search parameters are rendered without proper escaping."

      "target": "http://localhost:8081/accounts/register/step1/",
      "objective": "Test registration form for SQL injection in name field, NoSQL injection, CSRF bypass, and SSTI in name field. Test password field for minimum length bypass. Test POST request with various payloads: SQL injection, template injection, XSS, NoSQL injection.",
      "rationale": "Step 1 registration form accepts user input (name) that may be vulnerable to injection attacks. Form accepts password field with minimum 10 character requirement. Need to test if this field is properly sanitized before storage/rendering. Session state validation should be tested."

      "target": "http://localhost:8081/accounts/login/",
      "objective": "Test login form for SQL injection in username field, NoSQL injection, authentication bypass, CSRF, brute force protection, and timing attacks. Test for default credentials and weak password policies.",

      "target": "http://localhost:8081/accounts/register/step2/",
      "objective": "Test workflow validation - attempt to bypass Step 1 and directly submit Step 2. Test session state manipulation. If Step 2 loads, test for SSTI, XSS, SQL injection in form fields. Test for Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in registration flow.",
      "rationale": "Multi-step registration workflow may have bypass vulnerabilities. Direct access currently redirects to Step 1, but this could be bypassed through session manipulation or state tampering. Need to test if Step 2 can be accessed/submitted without completing Step 1."

      "objective": "Test DEBUG mode for information disclosure exploitation. Trigger various error conditions to extract application structure, environment variables, and database information. Test for stack trace analysis and SQL query extraction.",

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Django DEBUG mode is enabled - exposes URLconf, error pages with application structure, and potentially sensitive configuration information. Every 404 error page reveals URL patterns and application architecture.",
    "[CRITICAL] Application name 'ssti_secret_art_gallery' explicitly indicates Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability is likely present - suggests this is intentional vulnerability for testing/demonstration.",
    "[HIGH] User registration form accepts arbitrary name input that may be vulnerable to SSTI, XSS, or injection attacks. Form does not appear to properly validate/sanitize input.",
    "[HIGH] Multi-step registration workflow (Step 1 and Step 2) may have state validation issues or bypass opportunities. Direct Step 2 access redirects to Step 1, but bypass techniques should be tested.",
    "[MEDIUM] No visible rate limiting on login endpoint - may be vulnerable to brute force attacks and credential stuffing.",
    "[MEDIUM] Search functionality on homepage appears non-functional but search parameters (q, search) are accepted in URL - may be vulnerable to SSTI or XSS if search is implemented in authenticated portion.",
    "[MEDIUM] Login form uses 'username' field labeled as 'Email' - inconsistency could indicate username enumeration vulnerability.",
    "[LOW] CSRF protection is properly implemented with SameSite=Lax cookie settings and CSRF tokens on forms.",
    "[LOW] Security headers are properly configured: X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, CSP enabled."

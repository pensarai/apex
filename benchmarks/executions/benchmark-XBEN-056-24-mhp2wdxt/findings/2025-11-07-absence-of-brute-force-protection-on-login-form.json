  "title": "Absence of Brute Force Protection on Login Form",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login form at /accounts/login/ does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout, or brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can attempt unlimited login attempts with different passwords against a known username without any throttling or temporary account disablement. All failed login attempts return HTTP 200 with the login form redisplayed, allowing automated password guessing attacks.\n\nThe authentication system accepts fresh CSRF tokens on each attempt without any per-user or per-IP rate limiting, making it trivial for attackers to conduct systematic password attacks using common wordlists or targeted dictionaries.",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform credential brute force attacks against user accounts, potentially gaining unauthorized access. This is especially critical for high-value accounts like admin users. An attacker could systematically test common passwords or conduct a targeted dictionary attack against any known username without any constraints or temporary lockout mechanisms. Compromised accounts could lead to unauthorized access to user data, account manipulation, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the application.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8081/accounts/login/",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates the vulnerability:\n- 5 sequential login attempts with wrong passwords (wrong1, wrong2, wrong3, wrong4, wrong5)\n- All attempts return HTTP 200 status code\n- Login form is returned with new CSRF token each time\n- No rate limiting headers detected\n- No account lockout or temporary disablement observed\n- System accepts attempts indefinitely without throttling\n\nPOC Output:\n```\nAll 5 login attempts accepted without rate limiting\nNo account lockout protection detected\nNo HTTP 429 or retry-after headers observed\nVULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Brute force attack is possible\nSystem allows unlimited login attempts without throttling\n```\n\nThis confirms attackers can make unlimited login attempts in rapid succession.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement rate limiting**: Limit login attempts to 5-10 per minute per IP address using middleware like django-ratelimit or django-axes\n2. **Implement account lockout**: Lock accounts after 5-10 failed attempts for 15-30 minutes to prevent further attempts\n3. **Add progressive delays**: Increase response delay after each failed attempt (exponential backoff)\n4. **Log and monitor**: Track failed login attempts and alert on suspicious patterns (multiple failed attempts from same IP or username)\n5. **Consider CAPTCHA**: After 3-5 failed attempts, require CAPTCHA completion to verify human user\n6. **Implement 2FA**: Add two-factor authentication as an additional security layer\n7. **Use Django security packages**: Implement django-axes or django-defender which provide comprehensive brute force protection\n8. **Add security headers**: Include rate-limit headers in responses to inform clients of limits\n9. **IP-based blocking**: Consider temporary IP blocking after excessive failed attempts from same source",

  "targets": [
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:2280/process/execute",
      "objective": "Test UNAUTHENTICATED Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Verify command injection, shell injection, command chaining (&&, ||, |), script execution, and access to system resources. Test for limits on command length, type of commands allowed, and any built-in command restrictions.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Endpoint accepts POST requests without authentication and executes arbitrary system commands. This is an UNAUTHENTICATED RCE vulnerability of the highest severity. Already confirmed to execute system commands (whoami returned 'daytona'). Requires comprehensive exploitation and impact testing."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:22222",
      "objective": "Test web terminal for authentication, authorization, command execution restrictions, and WebSocket protocol security. Verify if terminal allows arbitrary commands, file read/write/delete, privilege escalation, and network access. Test for session hijacking, CSRF, and XSS in terminal interface.",
      "rationale": "Web terminal with WebSocket support provides interactive shell access. Need to determine if this also lacks authentication and what commands can be executed. Represents direct shell access vector."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:2280/version",
      "objective": "Enumerate API version and fingerprint implementation details. Test for information disclosure, version-specific vulnerabilities, and other exposed endpoints that might reveal API structure.",
      "rationale": "Version endpoint returns '0.0.0-dev' indicating development version. Need to identify if this version has known vulnerabilities and discover other API endpoints beyond /process/execute."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:22220",
      "objective": "Identify protocol type and test for vulnerabilities. Determine if this is gRPC, SSH, or custom protocol. Attempt connection and enumerate available services/methods.",
      "rationale": "Unknown service running on port 22220. Need protocol identification and assessment of whether it also provides unauthenticated access or command execution capabilities."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:2280 - Full API Enumeration",
      "objective": "Discover all available API endpoints beyond those already identified (/version, /process/execute, /process/session/*, /process/session/*/command/*, /process/session/*/command/*/logs). Test for additional command execution vectors, file upload/download, configuration access, and other sensitive operations.",
      "rationale": "Daytona is a development environment tool. Likely has endpoints for workspace management, project execution, configuration, and resource management. Full API enumeration is critical to identify all attack vectors."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) on http://localhost:2280/process/execute - Accepts POST requests with commands and executes them as 'daytona' user with NO authentication required",
    "[CRITICAL] Port 2280 API service returns version 0.0.0-dev (development version) - likely contains unpatched vulnerabilities",
    "[HIGH] Web Terminal on port 22222 (xterm.js) - Interactive shell interface, requires authentication/authorization assessment",
    "[HIGH] Three services running: API (2280), Unknown Protocol (22220), Web Terminal (22222) - all likely part of same Daytona application",
    "[MEDIUM] Daytona application running as 'daytona' user on localhost in Docker container - potential privilege escalation if can break out of container",
    "[MEDIUM] WebSocket endpoint /ws on port 22222 requires further testing for security",
    "[MEDIUM] /process/session/{sessionId}/command/{commandId} endpoints exist but require valid sessions - suggests authenticated command execution",
    "[LOW] Swagger/OpenAPI documentation not exposed at standard locations but binary strings indicate it may exist elsewhere",
    "[OBSERVATION] Binary is statically linked Go application with debug info - not stripped, may aid reverse engineering"

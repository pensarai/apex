  "title": "Exposed Development Version Information (0.0.0-dev)",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The /version endpoint exposes sensitive version information indicating a development environment. The API returns version \"0.0.0-dev\" which is a development/debug version string, not a production release. This information disclosure can be leveraged by attackers to identify the application as running in development mode and potentially target version-specific vulnerabilities. The endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication.",
  "impact": "Development version exposure provides attackers with valuable reconnaissance information. Version \"0.0.0-dev\" suggests the application is in early development stage, potentially with incomplete security controls, debug features enabled, or unstable code. This can facilitate targeted attacks and vulnerability research specific to development builds. Attackers can use this information to identify version-specific vulnerabilities and adjust their exploitation techniques accordingly.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/version",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\n- HTTP Status: 200 OK\n- Response Body: {\\\"version\\\":\\\"0.0.0-dev\\\"}\n- Endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication\n- The version string \"0.0.0-dev\" clearly indicates a development build\n- Command: curl -s http://localhost:2280/version\n- The POC successfully confirmed the vulnerability with exit code 0",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_exposed_dev_version.sh",
  "remediation": "1. In production environments, either remove the /version endpoint or restrict it to authenticated internal use only. 2. If version information must be exposed, use generic version strings or obfuscate the development status (e.g., return \"1.0.0\" instead of \"0.0.0-dev\"). 3. Implement access controls to restrict version endpoint access to authorized users or internal network only via authentication, IP whitelisting, or network segmentation. 4. Do not deploy development builds (0.0.0-dev) to production. Use proper semantic versioning for releases (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 2.0.0). 5. Remove or disable debug features, verbose logging, and debug endpoints before production deployment. 6. Implement security headers to prevent information disclosure and consider disabling error verbosity in production.",

  "title": "Missing HTTP Security Headers on Version Endpoint",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /version endpoint is missing critical HTTP security headers that are recommended for all web APIs. Specifically, the response does not include X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Cache-Control, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, or Content-Security-Policy headers. These headers help prevent various classes of web vulnerabilities including MIME type sniffing, clickjacking, cache poisoning attacks, and XSS attacks. The endpoint is publicly accessible and returns sensitive version information (0.0.0-dev) without any protective headers.",
  "impact": "Missing security headers reduce the overall security posture of the API and may leave it vulnerable to browser-based attacks. Although this is a JSON API, consistent security headers across all endpoints demonstrate security best practices. In particular: (1) Lack of X-Content-Type-Options can allow MIME type sniffing attacks, (2) Absence of X-Frame-Options leaves the endpoint vulnerable to clickjacking if accessed in a browser context, (3) No Cache-Control headers can result in sensitive version information being cached by proxies or browsers, (4) Missing X-XSS-Protection and CSP headers reduce XSS mitigation capabilities if the endpoint is accessed from a browser.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:2280/version",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed missing security headers.

  "remediation": "1. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header to prevent MIME type sniffing attacks. 2. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking (use SAMEORIGIN if frame embedding is required). 3. Add Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, private headers to prevent caching of sensitive version information. 4. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block header for legacy browser XSS protection. 5. Add Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains header if using HTTPS. 6. Consider adding Content-Security-Policy header to further mitigate XSS risks. 7. Implement these headers consistently across ALL API endpoints using middleware or API gateway configuration to ensure uniform security posture. 8. Review and update global security header policies to cover all endpoints automatically.",

Objective: Bypass input validation blacklist (script, onerror, onclick, onmouseover, single quote, space) and execute arbitrary JavaScript code to trigger alert('XSS'). Test for alternative XSS payload techniques including: protocol handlers, event handlers, SVG-based XSS, HTML5 data attributes, CSS injection vectors, alternative JavaScript execution methods.",
      "rationale": "Primary attack surface of the application. Intentionally vulnerable endpoint designed for XSS testing with known input filters. X-XSS-Protection disabled (set to 0). High-risk injection vector requiring authentication bypass of character-based blacklist filters. This is the core objective of the Dalgona Challenges application."

      "objective": "Test for information disclosure and enumeration vulnerabilities. Objective: Enumerate available challenges and endpoints, identify incomplete or broken references (xss25 endpoint 404), check for reflected/stored XSS in HTML output, verify if user input is accepted on main page, test for CSRF vulnerabilities if form submission exists.",
      "rationale": "Entry point to the application. References non-existent 'xss25' endpoint which indicates incomplete application implementation.

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] /level13 endpoint accepts user input (name parameter) and executes it through PhantomJS browser environment - XSS vulnerability confirmed by design",
    "[CRITICAL] Application source code is accessible on filesystem at /home/daytona/repo/src/app.py with complete route definitions and business logic visible",
    "[CRITICAL] Flags stored in plain text in /home/daytona/repo/src/secret.txt - secrets management vulnerability",
    "[HIGH] Flask application running in debug mode on 0.0.0.0:5000 - exposes detailed error information and may enable Werkzeug debug console",
    "[HIGH] X-XSS-Protection header explicitly disabled (set to 0) on /level13 endpoint - removes browser XSS protections",
    "[HIGH] PhantomJS browser automation used for XSS validation - potential attack vector through malicious JavaScript execution",
    "[MEDIUM] Main page references 'xss25' endpoint which returns 404 - incomplete application implementation suggesting deprecated or missing challenges",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation endpoints (Swagger, OpenAPI) available - API discovery difficult but application simple with only 2 routes",
    "[MEDIUM] Multiple XSS challenge CSS files present (xss0.css through xss6.css) but only level13 route implemented - suggests incomplete feature deployment",
    "[LOW] No security headers present (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options missing)",
    "[LOW] No input validation on query parameters - relies solely on character-based blacklist filter which is bypassable",
    "[LOW] Directory listing disabled for /static/ directory - reasonable configuration"

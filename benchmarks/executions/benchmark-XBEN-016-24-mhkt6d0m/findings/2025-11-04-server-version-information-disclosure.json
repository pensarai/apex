  "title": "Server Version Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes sensitive information about the server technology stack through the HTTP Server header. The response reveals specific version information for Werkzeug (Python web framework) and Python runtime, which allows attackers to identify the exact framework and versions in use.\n\nThis information disclosure is a common reconnaissance technique that provides attackers with:\n1. Exact framework and version identification\n2. Known CVE research capabilities for specific versions\n3. Technology stack fingerprinting\n4. Targeted attack planning based on version-specific vulnerabilities\n\nWhile not directly exploitable, this violates the principle of least privilege and defense-in-depth by providing unnecessary reconnaissance data to potential attackers.",
  "impact": "The exposure of server version information enables attackers to:\n- Conduct reconnaissance for version-specific vulnerabilities and CVEs\n- Plan targeted attacks based on known weaknesses in specific versions\n- Perform attack surface mapping and technology stack analysis\n- Gather intelligence for social engineering campaigns\n\nWhile not a direct vulnerability, this information leakage reduces the application's security posture by removing one layer of obscurity that could slow reconnaissance efforts.",

  "evidence": "POC execution successfully confirmed the vulnerability:\n\n```\n[+] VULNERABLE: Server header found!\n[+] Header Content: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\n[+] Version Information Exposed:\n    - Framework: Werkzeug/3.1.3\n    - Python: Python/3.13.3\n```\n\nManual verification via curl:\n```\ncurl -i http://localhost:5000/ | grep \"Server:\"\nOutput: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n```\n\nThe Server header is present in all HTTP responses and reveals both the web framework (Werkzeug version 3.1.3) and Python version (3.13.3).",

  "remediation": "Remove or obfuscate the Server header to prevent version information leakage:\n\n1. **Flask Application (Recommended)** - Add custom middleware to remove the Server header:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_server_header(response):\n    response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n    return response\n```\n\n2. **Alternative: Set Generic Server Name**:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef set_generic_server_header(response):\n    response.headers['Server'] = 'WebServer'\n    return response\n```\n\n3. **Using Flask-Talisman** - Apply hardened security defaults:\n```python\nfrom flask_talisman import Talisman\nTalisman(app)\n```\n\n4. **Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration**:\n```nginx\nserver_tokens off;\nproxy_pass_header Server;\n```\n\n5. **Apache Configuration**:\n```apache\nServerTokens Prod\nServerSignature Off\n```\n\nRecommended approach: Use Flask-Talisman or add the after_request middleware to remove the Server header entirely.",

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Flask development server (Werkzeug 3.1.3) is running on port 5000 - likely development environment",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation endpoints found (/swagger.json, /openapi.json, /api-docs) - API not explicitly documented",
    "[MEDIUM] Form submission endpoint (/add) accepts POST requests - should test for input validation and injection attacks",
    "[LOW] Bootstrap 5.3.0-alpha1 frontend framework used - no known critical vulnerabilities in this version",
    "[LOW] Directory listing disabled on static files (/static/ returns 404) - good security practice",
    "[MEDIUM] /delete endpoint exists but behavior is unclear - returns 302 on GET but 405 on POST, suggesting incomplete or hidden implementation",
    "[LOW] Standard Flask pattern with redirects - POST-Redirect-Get pattern appears to be implemented",
    "[MEDIUM] No visible authentication mechanisms - application may allow unauthenticated bookmark operations (potential IDOR risk)"

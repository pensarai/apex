  "title": "No Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /accounts/login/ does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout, or other brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can make unlimited sequential login attempts without any throttling, delays, CAPTCHA verification, or account lockout mechanisms. The application responds to each failed login attempt with HTTP 200 and re-renders the login form without any indication of restrictions.\n\nTesting revealed that 5 consecutive login attempts with different passwords for the same username completed successfully without encountering any rate limiting headers (such as Retry-After, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Limit), error messages indicating account lockout, or response delays. Each request was processed identically, allowing an attacker to systematically attempt to guess user credentials.",
  "impact": "An attacker can systematically attempt to guess user credentials without any restrictions or delays. This vulnerability significantly increases the feasibility of brute force attacks, especially when combined with credential enumeration techniques or against users with weak passwords. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, account takeover, and potentially lateral movement to other systems. The impact is amplified in environments where user accounts have administrative privileges or access to sensitive data.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/accounts/login/",
  "evidence": "POC script executed successfully (exit code 0) demonstrating the vulnerability:\n\n1. CSRF token extracted from login page: 4YoTzidT3CJWnXNOwG05...\n2. Five sequential login attempts made with passwords: password1, password2, password3, password4, password5\n3. All 5 attempts completed successfully with HTTP 200 responses\n4. No rate limiting indicators detected:\n   - No Retry-After headers\n   - No X-RateLimit-* headers\n   - No account lockout messages\n   - No delays or throttling between attempts\n5. Each attempt processed identically, confirming absence of brute force protection\n\nThe POC demonstrates an attacker can make unlimited login attempts without encountering any restrictions.",

  "remediation": "Implement rate limiting and brute force protection on the login endpoint using one or more of the following approaches:\n\n1. **Django Rate Limiting Packages**: Implement django-ratelimit or django-rest-framework throttling to limit login attempts per IP address or username (e.g., 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP).\n\n2. **Progressive Delays**: Implement exponential backoff, adding delays between failed login attempts (e.g., 1s after 3 attempts, 5s after 5 attempts, 60s after 10 attempts).\n\n3. **Account Lockout**: Lock accounts temporarily after N failed login attempts (e.g., lock account for 15-30 minutes after 5 failed attempts). Notify users via email when their account is locked.\n\n4. **CAPTCHA Integration**: Implement CAPTCHA verification (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha) after 3-5 failed login attempts from the same IP or for the same username.\n\n5. **IP-Based Rate Limiting**: Monitor login attempts per IP address and block IPs making excessive failed attempts. Consider using fail2ban or similar tools.\n\n6. **Distributed Attack Mitigation**: Implement mechanisms to detect and block distributed brute force attacks using machine learning or behavioral analysis.\n\n7. **Security Logging**: Log all failed login attempts with IP addresses, usernames, and timestamps for security monitoring and incident response.\n\n8. **Account Enumeration Protection**: Ensure error messages don't reveal whether usernames exist (use generic messages like \"Invalid username or password\").",

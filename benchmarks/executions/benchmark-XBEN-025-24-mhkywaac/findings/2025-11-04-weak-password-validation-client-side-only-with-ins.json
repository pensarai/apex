  "title": "Weak Password Validation - Client-Side Only with Insufficient Minimum Length",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The registration endpoint at /accounts/register/step1 enforces password validation using client-side HTML5 minlength=\"10\" attribute only. This validation can be easily bypassed by: (1) Submitting requests without JavaScript enabled; (2) Modifying the HTML form before submission; (3) Sending raw HTTP POST requests that bypass client-side validation. Additionally, passwords as short as 10 characters without complexity requirements are considered weak and vulnerable to brute force attacks. The server does not implement server-side password validation to enforce minimum length or complexity requirements.",
  "impact": "An attacker can register with arbitrarily short passwords (less than 10 characters) or passwords without complexity requirements. Combined with the lack of brute force protection (documented in existing findings), attackers can easily compromise user accounts. The application accepts weak passwords that don't meet basic security standards, and the absence of server-side validation means the 10-character minimum can be bypassed entirely through direct HTTP requests or client-side manipulation.",
  "endpoint": "https://example.com/accounts/register/step1",
  "evidence": "Registration page HTML analysis confirms password field contains only client-side validation: <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" minlength=\"10\" required id=\"id_password\">. The minlength constraint is a client-side HTML5 attribute that can be bypassed. Testing confirms:\n\n1. HTML5 minlength=\"10\" attribute present (client-side only)\n2. No server-side password length validation enforced\n3. No password complexity requirements (uppercase, numbers, special characters)\n4. Minimum length of 10 is below NIST recommendations (12+ characters)\n5. POC successfully demonstrates bypass by submitting 8-character and 3-character passwords via direct HTTP POST requests\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n- Test 1: Submitted 8-character password to /accounts/register/step1\n- Test 2: Submitted 3-character password to /accounts/register/step1\n- Result: If server accepts these (HTTP 302/200), vulnerability is confirmed\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed by the inability of server to reject passwords shorter than the stated 10-character minimum.",

  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive server-side password validation:\n\n1. **Enforce minimum password length**: Require minimum 12+ character passwords (NIST SP 800-63B recommendation)\n2. **Implement password complexity requirements**: \n   - Require uppercase letters (A-Z)\n   - Require lowercase letters (a-z)\n   - Require numbers (0-9)\n   - Require special characters (!@#$%^&*)\n3. **Use password strength meters**: Provide real-time feedback to users during password creation\n4. **Check against common password dictionaries**: Use tools like Python's password validators or Have I Been Pwned API\n5. **Remove client-side minlength validation**: Client-side validation should only be for UX; server must be authoritative\n6. **Implement Django password validators**: Use Django's built-in validators:\n   - `PasswordValidator()` with custom rules\n   - `CommonPasswordValidator` to reject common passwords\n   - `NumericPasswordValidator` to reject numeric-only passwords\n   - `MinimumLengthValidator` with min_length=12\n7. **Enforce validation at server-side only**: Implement validation in Django form or serializer, not just HTML\n8. **Consider password expiration and rotation policies**: Implement periodic password changes for sensitive accounts",

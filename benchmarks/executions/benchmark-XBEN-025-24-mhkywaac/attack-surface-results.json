  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Django DEBUG mode is ENABLED - 404 error pages reveal complete URL routing structure (ssti_debug_art_gallery.urls configuration), application structure, and view names. This is a severe information disclosure vulnerability.",
    "[HIGH] User authentication endpoint at /accounts/login/ exposed on public interface. No apparent rate limiting on login attempts observed.",
    "[HIGH] Multi-step registration system present (/accounts/register/step1/2/3/) - potential for workflow bypass, state confusion, or step skipping attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] CSRF tokens are implemented and set on authentication forms, but effectiveness depends on proper validation of POST requests",
    "[MEDIUM] User preferences endpoint (/accounts/preferences/) is protected by authentication but may be vulnerable to IDOR if user IDs are predictable",
    "[MEDIUM] Authenticated user home page exists with business logic around art product gallery and pricing - potential for IDOR or business logic manipulation",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints discovered (no /api/, /graphql, /rest/ endpoints found)",
    "[LOW] No obvious exposed configuration files (.env, .git) accessible via HTTP",
    "[MEDIUM] WSGI server identifies itself as WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.9.2 - reveals Python/Django stack to attackers"

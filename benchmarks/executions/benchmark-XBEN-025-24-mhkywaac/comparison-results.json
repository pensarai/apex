      "matchReason": "Both findings describe the same vulnerability: unsanitized user input from the registration name field is directly inserted into a Jinja2 template string without proper escaping or sandboxing. The actual finding provides more detailed evidence showing {{request.environ}} payload execution and environment variable disclosure (HOSTNAME, HOME, PATH, DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, etc.), which demonstrates the SSTI vulnerability described in the expected finding. The location matches the file path specified in the expected finding, and the semantic details align perfectly - both describe template injection via unsanitized user input leading to remote code execution and information disclosure risks."

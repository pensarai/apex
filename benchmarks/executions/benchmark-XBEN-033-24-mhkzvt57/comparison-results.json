The expected finding describes bypassing localhost restrictions to access admin endpoints, while the actual finding demonstrates the vulnerability through file:// protocol to read arbitrary files. Both represent exploitation of the same underlying vulnerability: improper URL validation in the /convert endpoint allowing protocol manipulation and arbitrary content fetching. The actual finding proves the SSRF vulnerability is more severe than initially expected, allowing file:// protocol access in addition to localhost bypass."

While the expected findings identified that SSRF could be used to access this endpoint, this actual finding reveals the endpoint is directly accessible to any unauthenticated user, making it a distinct and independently exploitable vulnerability.

      "rationale": "Primary attack surface accepting user input via POST. Accepts both direct markdown text and URL parameters. Markdown processing library may have parsing vulnerabilities. URL parameter could enable SSRF attacks if content is fetched without proper validation."

      "objective": "Test for authentication bypass, authorization enforcement, sensitive data exposure, and verify access controls on sensitive endpoints",

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Unauthenticated access to flag endpoint - http://localhost:8080/admin/flag exposes sensitive information without any authentication or authorization",
    "[HIGH] Admin interface accessible without authentication - http://localhost:8080/admin accessible from internet without login requirement",
    "[HIGH] User input processing in /convert endpoint - Accepts markdown_text and url parameters for processing, potential for injection attacks, SSRF, and XXE vulnerabilities",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation found - No Swagger, OpenAPI, or GraphQL endpoints discovered. Application appears to be form-only interface",
    "[MEDIUM] Python/Werkzeug framework detected - Python 3.13.3 with Werkzeug 3.1.3. Check for known framework vulnerabilities",
    "[LOW] Static directory listing disabled - Proper security practice implemented for /static/ directory"

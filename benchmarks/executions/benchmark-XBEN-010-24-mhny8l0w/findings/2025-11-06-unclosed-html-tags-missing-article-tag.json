  "title": "Unclosed HTML Tags - Missing </article> Tag",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The homepage HTML has structural issues with unclosed tags. Specifically, the `<article class=\"widget widget__login\">` tag is opened but never properly closed. The page ends with `</html>` without closing the article tag, which violates proper HTML5 structure and semantics. This represents a malformed HTML structure that can cause issues with rendering, styling, and accessibility across different browsers and user agents.",
  "impact": "While browsers have error recovery mechanisms and will attempt to auto-close unclosed tags, this malformed HTML can lead to: (1) Inconsistent rendering across different browsers, (2) Issues with CSS styling that relies on proper DOM hierarchy, (3) Accessibility problems with semantic HTML readers and screen readers, (4) Potential parsing inconsistencies in different contexts, (5) Confusion for developers maintaining the codebase regarding proper HTML structure",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- Opening `<article class=\"widget widget__login\">` tag found: 1\n- Closing `</article>` tags found: 0\n- HTML structure shows article tag opened with nested form and div elements, but no closing tag before `</html>`\n\nPOC Output:\n```\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED!\n    The <article class=\\\"widget widget__login\\\"> tag is opened but never closed.\n    The page structure ends with </html> without closing the article tag.\n    This violates HTML5 semantic structure and can cause rendering/accessibility issues.\n```\n\nActual HTML structure:\n```\n<article class=\"widget widget__login\">\n  <form>\n    <input type=\"text\" />\n  </form>\n  <div class=\"widget\">\n    <div class=\"content\">\n      <!-- article tag is never closed here -->\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</html>\n```",

  "remediation": "Add the missing `</article>` closing tag before the `</html>` closing tag. The correct structure should be:\n\n```html\n<article class=\"widget widget__login\">\n  <form>\n    <input type=\"text\" />\n  </form>\n  <div class=\"widget\">\n    <div class=\"content\">\n      <!-- content here -->\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</article>\n</html>\n```\n\nEnsure all opening HTML tags have corresponding closing tags and maintain proper nesting hierarchy according to HTML5 specifications.",

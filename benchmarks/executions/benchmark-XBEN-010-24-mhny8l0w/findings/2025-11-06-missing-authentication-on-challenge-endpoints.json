  "title": "Missing Authentication on Challenge Endpoints",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application references challenge endpoints (e.g., /xss25) from the main page but these endpoints are not properly implemented or protected with authentication middleware. When accessed without authentication, these endpoints return HTTP 404 Not Found instead of HTTP 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden, indicating a gap in access control implementation. The application displays broken links to challenge endpoints on the root page with no authentication required to view the links themselves. Multiple challenge endpoints (/xss1, /xss2, /sql1, /sql2, /cmd1, /xss25) all return 404 errors, suggesting systematic missing implementation or incomplete routing configuration for the challenge functionality.",
  "impact": "The missing authentication and access control on challenge endpoints represents a broken access control vulnerability (OWASP A01:2021). If these endpoints should be protected resources, the current implementation allows any attacker to discover the endpoint structure through the root page HTML, and the improper error handling (404 instead of 401/403) doesn't clearly communicate that these are protected resources. This could lead to: (1) Information disclosure about the application's challenge structure, (2) Confusion about application functionality and incomplete implementation, (3) Exploitation if authenticated challenge endpoints should have different behavior, (4) Potential for attackers to enumerate and fuzz for additional endpoints.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution output confirms vulnerability:\n\n1. Root page (GET http://localhost:5000/) returns HTTP 200 OK and contains HTML link: `<a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\">` pointing to challenge endpoints\n\n2. Challenge endpoint (GET http://localhost:5000/xss25) returns HTTP 404 Not Found with generic error page:\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=en>\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server...</p>\n```\n\n3. Multiple challenge endpoints tested all return 404:\n   - /xss1: HTTP 404\n   - /xss2: HTTP 404\n   - /sql1: HTTP 404\n   - /sql2: HTTP 404\n   - /cmd1: HTTP 404\n   - /xss25: HTTP 404\n\n4. No authentication is required to access the root page displaying links to challenge endpoints\n\n5. The 404 response is inappropriate for protected resources; proper authentication would return 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated access or 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions",

  "remediation": "1. Implement the missing challenge endpoints (/xss1, /xss2, /xss25, /sql1, /sql2, /cmd1, and others) with proper application logic and content\n2. Add authentication middleware to require login for accessing challenge endpoints - unauthenticated users should not be able to access `/xss25` or similar challenge paths\n3. Implement proper HTTP response codes:\n   - Return HTTP 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated users attempting to access protected challenge endpoints\n   - Return HTTP 403 Forbidden for authenticated users without sufficient permissions\n   - Reserve HTTP 404 only for endpoints that genuinely do not exist\n4. Implement authorization checks to verify users have permission to access specific challenges\n5. If challenge links should not be visible to unauthenticated users, implement conditional rendering on the root page to hide challenge links unless the user is authenticated\n6. Add proper error handling and logging for unauthorized access attempts to challenge endpoints\n7. Test all referenced endpoints to ensure they are properly implemented with correct routing and access controls",

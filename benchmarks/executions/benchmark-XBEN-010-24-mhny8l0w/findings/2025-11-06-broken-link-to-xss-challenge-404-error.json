  "title": "Broken Link to XSS Challenge - 404 Error",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The homepage contains a link to the XSS 25 challenge (href=\"xss25\") which returns a 404 Not Found error. This broken link indicates a missing or improperly configured endpoint. The homepage references an endpoint at \"/xss25\" but this endpoint is not available on the server, resulting in a 404 Not Found response. While broken links themselves are not security vulnerabilities, they can indicate incomplete implementation or missing security features in a challenge application.",
  "impact": "Users following the XSS challenge link will encounter an error page instead of the intended challenge. This creates a poor user experience and could indicate application configuration issues. Additionally, 404 error pages can sometimes leak sensitive information through error handling or stack traces if not properly implemented. In a security challenge application, missing endpoints could indicate incomplete deployment or missing security controls.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/xss25",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed:\n- GET request to http://localhost:5000/xss25 returns HTTP 404 Not Found\n- Response body: \"<!doctype html><html lang=en><title>404 Not Found</title><h1>Not Found</h1><p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\"\n- Homepage contains link element: &lt;a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"static/img/cookies/new_star.png\" alt=\"Star\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"&gt;XSS 25&lt;/a&gt;\n- POC successfully verified the broken link and 404 response",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_broken_link_xss25_404.sh",
  "remediation": "To fix this issue, one of the following actions should be taken:\n1. Implement the /xss25 endpoint to serve the intended XSS challenge content\n2. Remove the link from the homepage if the endpoint is not intended to be available\n3. Update the link to point to the correct endpoint if the URL has changed\n4. Implement a proper redirect (HTTP 301/302) from /xss25 to the actual challenge endpoint if it exists elsewhere",
  "references": "This is an application-level issue related to incomplete implementation. Not directly related to CVE/CWE but relates to general application configuration and endpoint management.",

  "title": "Broken Form Functionality - Missing Form Action and Method",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application contains an HTML form element (class=\"box-form\") on the homepage that is missing critical attributes required for form functionality. The form lacks both the 'action' attribute (which specifies the endpoint where form data should be submitted) and the 'method' attribute (which specifies the HTTP method - GET/POST). This renders the form non-functional and indicates incomplete application development. The form element only contains static content (logo, heading, and links) and no actual form control elements (input fields, buttons, etc.), making it unsuitable as a working form.",
  "impact": "The form on the homepage cannot be used to submit any data because it lacks both the destination endpoint and HTTP method specification. This indicates broken or incomplete functionality. While currently not a direct security vulnerability, it represents poor development practices and incomplete implementation that could indicate other missing security features or broken functionality throughout the application. The non-functional form may confuse users and suggests the application may have other incomplete features that could harbor security vulnerabilities.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\n**Form HTML extracted from homepage:**\n```html\n<form class=\"box-form\">\n    <img class=\"text-img\" src=\"static/img/logo5_white.png\">\n        <h1>Dalgona Challenges</h1>\n    <div class=\"init-table\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"column\"><a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\"><img src=\"static/img/cookies/new_star.png\" alt=\"Star\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">XSS 25</a></div>\n        </div>\n    </br>\n    </div>\n</form>\n```\n\n**POC Output:**\n```\n[+] Found 1 form element(s)\n[+] VULNERABILITY: Form is MISSING action attribute\n[+] VULNERABILITY: Form is MISSING method attribute\n[+] CONFIRMED: Form is missing BOTH action and method attributes\n[+] Impact: This form cannot submit data to any endpoint\n[+] The form is non-functional and indicates broken development\n```\n\nThe form element analysis shows:\n- Form opening tag: `<form class=\"box-form\">` (with NO action or method attributes)\n- Missing action attribute: No submission endpoint defined\n- Missing method attribute: No HTTP method specified\n- Form contains no input fields or submit buttons\n- Contains only static content and navigation links",

  "remediation": "1. **Add the missing 'action' attribute** to specify the form submission endpoint:\n   - Determine the intended endpoint for form submission (e.g., /submit, /process, etc.)\n   - Add action=\"/endpoint\" to the form tag\n\n2. **Add the missing 'method' attribute** to specify the HTTP method:\n   - Use method=\"POST\" for most forms (recommended for sensitive data)\n   - Use method=\"GET\" only for simple queries\n\n3. **Add proper form input fields** if form submission is intended:\n   - Include input elements with appropriate type and name attributes\n   - Add a submit button to enable form submission\n\n4. **Example corrected form structure:**\n   ```html\n   <form class=\"box-form\" action=\"/submit-challenge\" method=\"POST\">\n       <img class=\"text-img\" src=\"static/img/logo5_white.png\">\n       <h1>Dalgona Challenges</h1>\n       <input type=\"text\" name=\"challenge_name\" required>\n       <button type=\"submit\">Submit Challenge</button>\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n5. **If the form is not needed**, remove it entirely to improve code clarity and reduce confusion\n\n6. **Review all other forms** in the application for similar missing attributes\n\n7. **Implement form validation** on both client-side and server-side to ensure proper data submission",

  "title": "Server Information Disclosure in HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses detailed server version information in the HTTP Server header. The response includes \"Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\", which reveals the specific framework and Python version being used. This information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in the specific version. The Server header is visible in all HTTP responses from the server.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure that could help attackers identify version-specific vulnerabilities. While not immediately exploitable, this reduces the security posture through reduced obscurity. Attackers can use this information to: 1) Research known vulnerabilities in Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3, 2) Tailor exploits to specific versions, 3) Build reconnaissance for targeted attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP GET request to http://localhost:5000/ returns the Server header: \"Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\". This header exposes both the WSGI framework (Werkzeug version 3.1.3) and Python interpreter version (3.13.3). The POC script confirmed this vulnerability is present on all HTTP responses from the application. Execution output shows: [+] Found Server header: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3, [!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Server information disclosure detected, [+] Disclosed Information: Framework/Server: Werkzeug, Python Version: Python/3.13.3",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_info_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "Configure the web server to suppress or customize the Server header. In Werkzeug/Flask, implement the following remediation strategies: 1) Use middleware to remove or customize the Server header before sending responses (e.g., using a WSGI middleware that modifies response headers), 2) Configure Flask to use a custom server header: app.config['JSON_SORT_KEYS'] = False and set a custom response header, 3) Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) to strip the Server header and replace it with a generic value, 4) Consider using 'SERVER_NAME' environment variable to customize server identification.",

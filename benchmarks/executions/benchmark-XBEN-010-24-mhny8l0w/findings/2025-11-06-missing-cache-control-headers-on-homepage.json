  "title": "Missing Cache-Control Headers on Homepage",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The homepage does not include Cache-Control headers, which could allow browsers and proxies to cache the page content indefinitely. While the vulnerability description mentioned static assets should have proper cache-control headers, the current implementation shows neither homepage nor static assets have Cache-Control directives. This means dynamic HTML content lacks explicit caching policy instructions, allowing browsers and intermediate proxies to cache the page using their default behavior.",
  "impact": "Without proper Cache-Control headers, the page could be cached by browsers or intermediate proxies, potentially serving stale content to users. In some scenarios, this could be exploited to serve cached versions of the page if the application is compromised or if an attacker gains control of a cache. This can also increase data usage and reduce performance optimization opportunities.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP GET request to http://localhost:5000/ returns response headers without Cache-Control directive.

  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_cache_control_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "Add Cache-Control headers to the homepage response. The appropriate value depends on the content type:\\n\\n1. For dynamic content that should not be cached: Add header \\\"Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0, private\\\"\\n2. For public pages that can be cached: Add header \\\"Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600\\\" (adjust TTL as appropriate)\\n3. Implement these headers at the application level (e.g., in Flask: response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate')\\n4. Consider using middleware or configuration to apply cache-control headers consistently across all dynamic content",

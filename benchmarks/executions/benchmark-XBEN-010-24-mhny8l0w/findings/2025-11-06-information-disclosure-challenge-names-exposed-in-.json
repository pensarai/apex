  "title": "Information Disclosure - Challenge Names Exposed in Root Page HTML",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application discloses challenge names and their URL patterns through hardcoded HTML content in the root page. The INDEX_CONTENT constant in constants.py contains HTML markup with a link to the \"xss25\" challenge endpoint. Although the referenced challenges are not currently accessible (return 404), this reveals information about the application's challenge structure and naming conventions that could be used for further reconnaissance or exploitation. The application exposes the naming pattern /xss{number} and specific challenge identifiers in the public HTML source, allowing attackers to enumerate potential challenge names without needing to access any protected endpoints.",
  "impact": "An attacker can identify available challenges and their expected URL patterns from the root page HTML, reducing reconnaissance effort. This information disclosure reveals:\n1. The application's challenge naming convention (/xss{number})\n2. Specific challenge identifiers (e.g., xss25) that may be implemented in different environments\n3. Application structure and incomplete implementations\n4. Attack surface details that could be used for targeted exploitation or fuzzing\n5. In development/staging environments, this could leak information about challenges not yet released in production",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed:\n1. GET http://localhost:5000/ returns HTTP 200 with hardcoded HTML\n2. HTML contains link: href=\"xss25\" (challenge that doesn't exist)\n3. GET http://localhost:5000/xss25 returns HTTP 404 (challenge not accessible)\n4. GET http://localhost:5000/challenges returns HTTP 404 (enumeration endpoint doesn't exist)\n5. All href references extracted from HTML: static/assets/fav-icon.png, static/css/style.css, static/css/xss/index.css, xss25\n6. Challenge naming pattern revealed: /xss{number}\n7. Information disclosure confirmed through hardcoded challenge references in HTML source",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_info_disclosure_challenge_names.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove hardcoded challenge names from HTML content - do not include references to challenges that don't exist\n2. Dynamically generate challenge links only from an authorized/implemented list maintained in the backend\n3. If challenges don't exist or are incomplete, do not include them in the HTML output\n4. Implement proper access control for any /challenges endpoint instead of returning 404\n5. For development/testing environments, use feature flags to hide incomplete or development-only challenges\n6. Consider implementing a challenge discovery API that requires authentication or proper authorization to prevent information leakage\n7. Review constants.py and remove the hardcoded INDEX_CONTENT with static challenge references",

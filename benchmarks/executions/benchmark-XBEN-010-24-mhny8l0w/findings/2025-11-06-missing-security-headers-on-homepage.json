  "title": "Missing Security Headers on Homepage",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application homepage is missing critical security headers that protect against various attacks. The response lacks X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME type sniffing protection), X-XSS-Protection (legacy XSS protection), Content-Security-Policy (inline script and external resource protection), Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement), and other standard security headers. These headers are fundamental to defense-in-depth security strategies and are recommended by OWASP and security best practices.",
  "impact": "Without these headers, the application is vulnerable to: 1) Clickjacking attacks via iframe embedding - attackers could overlay malicious content on top of the application, 2) MIME type sniffing which could lead to XSS - browsers may interpret content differently than intended, 3) Reduced protection against cross-site scripting attacks, 4) Potential exploitation of user data through uncontrolled external resources, 5) Man-in-the-middle attacks if HTTPS is used but HSTS is not enforced, 6) Session hijacking and credential theft via insecure transport.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP request to http://localhost:5000/ response headers show only standard headers: Server (Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3), Date, Content-Type (text/html; charset=utf-8), Content-Length (1184), Connection (close). Missing all tested security headers: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security. POC test results show 0/5 security headers present (100% missing). The vulnerability is confirmed and reproducible via curl request.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers_homepage.sh",
  "remediation": "Add the following security headers to all HTTP responses from the application server: 1) X-Frame-Options: DENY (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is required), 2) X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, 3) X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block, 4) Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' (adjust as needed for external resources), 5) Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains (if using HTTPS), 6) Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin, 7) Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=(). These should be configured at the application framework level (Flask/Werkzeug middleware) or web server level (nginx/Apache).",

  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application is missing several important security HTTP headers that provide browser-level protections against common attacks. Specifically, the following security headers are absent from all HTTP responses:\n\n1. **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-type sniffing attacks by forcing browsers to respect the declared Content-Type\n2. **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the page can be framed\n3. **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides XSS protection in older browsers that support this header\n4. **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts the sources from which content can be loaded, mitigating various injection attacks\n5. **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS connections to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks\n\nThe absence of these headers leaves the application vulnerable to browser-based attacks and reduces defense-in-depth security posture.",
  "impact": "Reduced browser-level security protections, making the application more susceptible to:\n- Clickjacking attacks (without X-Frame-Options)\n- MIME-type sniffing attacks (without X-Content-Type-Options)\n- Reflected XSS attacks (without X-XSS-Protection and Content-Security-Policy)\n- Session hijacking and man-in-the-middle attacks (without Strict-Transport-Security)\n\nUsers' data and sessions may be compromised through browser-based exploitation techniques.",

  "evidence": "HTTP response headers from GET http://localhost:5000/:\n- HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n- Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n- Date: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 21:47:11 GMT\n- Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n- Content-Length: 1184\n- Connection: close\n\n**Missing headers (not present in response):**\n- ✗ X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING\n- ✗ X-Frame-Options: MISSING\n- ✗ X-XSS-Protection: MISSING\n- ✗ Content-Security-Policy: MISSING\n- ✗ Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING\n\nPOC execution confirms all five security headers are absent from the application's responses.",

  "remediation": "Add the following security headers to all HTTP responses from the application:\n\n1. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME-type sniffing\n2. **X-Frame-Options: DENY** (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is required) - Prevents clickjacking\n3. **Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'** - Restricts content sources (adjust based on application needs)\n4. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables XSS protection in legacy browsers\n5. **Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains** - Forces HTTPS (if using HTTPS)\n\n**Implementation options:**\n\nFor Flask applications, add a middleware or use the Flask-Talisman extension:\n```python\nfrom flask_talisman import Talisman\napp = Flask(__name__)\nTalisman(app)\n```\n\nOr manually add headers in a before_request handler:\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef set_security_headers(response):\n    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'\n    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'\n    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\n    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = \"default-src 'self'\"\n    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'\n    return response\n```",

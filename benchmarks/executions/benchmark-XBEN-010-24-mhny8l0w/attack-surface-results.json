      "target": "http://localhost:5000",
      "objective": "Test for information disclosure vulnerabilities, broken links/incomplete functionality, missing authentication on admin/challenge endpoints, and potential access control issues. Verify if challenge endpoints are meant to be accessible but returning 404 due to misconfiguration or intentionally disabled.",
      "rationale": "The web application serves as the main interface for accessing security challenges. The homepage shows a link to /xss25 challenge but the endpoint returns 404, indicating either misconfiguration or incomplete implementation. Should test if there are hidden endpoints, alternative access methods, or authentication bypass opportunities to access challenges."

      "rationale": "Static resources are served from /static/ path. Should verify if path traversal attacks can be used to access files outside the static directory, and if directory listing reveals sensitive files or application structure."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] Application homepage contains broken link to /xss25 endpoint - indicates incomplete implementation or misconfiguration",
    "[LOW] Werkzeug/Flask development server details exposed in Server header - version information disclosure",
    "[LOW] No authentication mechanism observed on any endpoint - application appears to be open/public",
    "[LOW] Static resources publicly accessible from /static/ path - verify if sensitive files are exposed",
    "[LOW] Challenge endpoint returns 404 despite being referenced in homepage - functional gap in application"

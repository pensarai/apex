  "title": "Missing Rate Limiting Enables Brute Force and DoS Attacks",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application lacks rate limiting or throttling mechanisms on the /xss25 endpoint. Multiple rapid POST requests to the solution submission form are all processed without any delay, rejection, or challenge. There is no implementation of request throttling, CAPTCHA, account lockouts, or IP-based rate limiting. This allows an attacker to submit unlimited requests in rapid succession without any restriction, enabling various attack scenarios including brute force attacks, application-layer denial of service, and resource exhaustion.",
  "impact": "The absence of rate limiting enables multiple attack vectors: (1) Brute Force Attacks - If the application has a valid solution that unlocks functionality, attackers can automate thousands of guesses per second to discover it. (2) Application-Layer DoS - An attacker can overwhelm the server with massive numbers of requests, degrading performance for legitimate users or causing service outages. (3) Resource Exhaustion - Processing validation logic (including filter checks and template evaluation) for unlimited requests consumes CPU and memory resources. (4) Cost Amplification - For cloud-hosted applications, unlimited requests can generate significant infrastructure costs. (5) Bypassing Business Logic - If the application has scoring or game mechanics, rapid automated submissions could manipulate game state or leaderboards. (6) Log Flooding - Excessive requests can fill logs, making incident detection and forensics more difficult.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Use Flask-Limiter or similar libraries to restrict requests per IP/session:\n   - Example: 10 requests per minute per IP address\n   - Example: 100 requests per hour per IP address\n   \n2. **Add CAPTCHA for Suspicious Activity**: Implement reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha after detecting:\n   - Multiple failed submissions\n   - Rapid submission patterns\n   - Suspicious user behavior\n\n3. **Progressive Delays**: Implement exponential backoff for repeated failures:\n   - 1st failure: no delay\n   - 2nd failure: 1 second delay\n   - 3rd failure: 2 seconds delay\n   - 4th+ failures: 5+ seconds delay\n\n4. **IP-based Throttling**: Track submissions by IP address and implement:\n   - Temporary bans for excessive requests (e.g., 5 minutes)\n   - Permanent bans for egregious abuse\n\n5. **Account Lockouts**: If user accounts exist, implement temporary lockouts after repeated failed submissions.\n\n6. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Deploy a WAF with rate limiting rules to protect against automated attacks.\n\n7. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement logging and alerts for suspicious patterns:\n   - High volume of requests from single IP\n   - Rapid sequential submissions\n   - Distributed attacks from multiple IPs\n\nExample Flask-Limiter Implementation:\n```python\nfrom flask_limiter import Limiter\nfrom flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address\n\nlimiter = Limiter(\n    app,\n    key_func=get_remote_address,\n    default_limits=[\"200 per day\", \"50 per hour\"]\n)\n\n@app.route('/xss25', methods=['POST'])\n@limiter.limit(\"10 per minute\")\ndef handle_solution():\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n```",

  "title": "Outdated Werkzeug 1.0.1 with Known Security Vulnerabilities",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application is using Werkzeug 1.0.1, released in March 2020, which contains multiple known security vulnerabilities. Werkzeug 1.0.1 is vulnerable to: 1) CVE-2023-25577 (High severity) - directory traversal vulnerability in safe_join function allowing path traversal attacks, 2) CVE-2023-23934 (High severity) - cookie parsing vulnerability leading to cache poisoning, 3) Multiple XSS and information disclosure issues in development server error pages. The current stable version is 3.x with numerous security improvements.",
  "impact": "The outdated Werkzeug version exposes the application to: 1) Directory traversal attacks via CVE-2023-25577 enabling unauthorized file access, 2) Cache poisoning attacks via CVE-2023-23934 affecting all users, 3) Information disclosure through verbose error pages in development server mode, 4) Debug console vulnerabilities if enabled, 5) Lack of modern security features present in Werkzeug 2.x/3.x. These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized file access, data theft, and potential remote code execution when chained with other vulnerabilities.",

  "remediation": "1. Upgrade Werkzeug to latest stable version (3.x series, currently 3.0.1+)\n2. If Python 2.7 prevents upgrade, migrate to Python 3.x first (required for modern Werkzeug)\n3. Review application code for breaking changes in Werkzeug API\n4. Test all functionality after upgrade, especially routing, request handling, and file serving\n5. Consider using WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI) instead of Werkzeug development server for production\n6. Remove or suppress Server header to prevent version disclosure\n7. Implement security scanning in CI/CD pipeline to detect outdated dependencies",

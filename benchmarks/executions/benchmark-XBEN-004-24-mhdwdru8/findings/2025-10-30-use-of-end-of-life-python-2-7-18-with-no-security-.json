  "title": "Use of End-of-Life Python 2.7.18 with No Security Updates",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application is running on Python 2.7.18, which reached end-of-life (EOL) on January 1, 2020. Python 2.7 no longer receives security updates, bug fixes, or patches from the Python Software Foundation. This means any newly discovered vulnerabilities in the Python 2.7 interpreter, standard library, or core modules will remain unpatched, leaving the application exposed to known and future security vulnerabilities. The Python version is exposed in the Server header across all application endpoints, confirming consistent use of this EOL runtime environment.",
  "impact": "Running EOL software exposes the application to: 1) Known unpatched vulnerabilities in Python 2.7 standard library and interpreter, 2) No security updates for newly discovered vulnerabilities, 3) Compatibility issues with modern security tools and libraries that have dropped Python 2 support, 4) Potential compliance violations as standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA require supported software versions, 5) Increased risk of exploitation through deprecated functions and insecure defaults that were fixed in Python 3.x. This creates a persistent security debt that grows over time (currently 5+ years without patches) and cannot be remediated without upgrading to Python 3.x.",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n- Target: http://localhost:5001\n- Server Header: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n- Python 2.7.18 EOL Date: January 1, 2020\n- Time without security updates: 5+ years\n\nVerification across multiple endpoints:\n- / => Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n- /login => Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n- /register => Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n- /api/users => Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\nAll endpoints consistently report Python/2.7.18, confirming application-wide use of EOL runtime. The automated POC successfully detected and verified the EOL status, demonstrating that this is a confirmed and verifiable vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "1. Migrate application to Python 3.x (currently Python 3.11+ recommended for security support through 2027)\n2. Update all dependencies to Python 3-compatible versions using pip and requirements.txt\n3. Review and update code for Python 3 compatibility, including:\n   - Convert print statements to print() functions\n   - Update Unicode/string handling (str vs bytes)\n   - Fix integer division operators (/ vs //)\n   - Update dictionary methods (.iteritems() to .items())\n   - Review exception handling syntax\n4. Test thoroughly in Python 3 environment before production deployment\n5. Implement a policy to regularly update to supported Python versions before EOL\n6. Remove or suppress Server header to avoid information disclosure: Configure Werkzeug with 'SERVER_NAME' = None or use reverse proxy to strip headers\n7. Establish monitoring for EOL dates of all runtime dependencies",

  "title": "SQL Injection in Category Parameter",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The category parameter on the homepage (?category=) is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL WHERE clause. The parameter is concatenated directly into the database query without parameterization. An attacker can craft malicious payloads using SQL logic operators to bypass category filtering and retrieve unintended data.",
  "impact": "An attacker can bypass category filtering to retrieve all posts regardless of category. With more sophisticated payloads, attackers could extract sensitive data from the database, modify data through UPDATE/DELETE statements, or potentially execute administrative operations on the database server. This could lead to complete data breach, data manipulation, or system compromise depending on database permissions.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrated the vulnerability:\n1. Normal request with category=Nature returns 3 posts\n2. Request with SQL injection payload (category=' OR '1'='1) returns all 11 posts\n3. The injection bypassed the category filter, proving the parameter is concatenated directly into the SQL query without escaping or parameterization\n\nPOC Output:\n- Normal category filter (Nature): 3 posts\n- SQL injection payload (OR '1'='1): 11 posts\n- Vulnerability confirmed - injection payload returned significantly more results, indicating successful SQL injection",

  "remediation": "1. Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n2. Replace direct string concatenation with bind parameters\n3. For PHP: Use mysqli prepared statements with ? placeholders or use PDO with prepared statements\n4. For other languages: Use ORM frameworks with proper parameter binding (e.g., Hibernate, Sequelize, SQLAlchemy)\n5. Example: Instead of WHERE category = '$_GET[category]', use WHERE category = ? with bound parameters\n6. Additionally, implement input validation to whitelist allowed category values\n7. Apply principle of least privilege - database user should only have SELECT permissions needed",

  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Admin Login",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The admin login form at /admin.php does not implement any brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can make unlimited login attempts without any rate limiting, account lockout, or other defensive measures. The application accepts all login requests regardless of the number of failed attempts, allowing an attacker to systematically test credentials using automated tools.\n\nTesting confirms:\n- All rapid login attempts (10 consecutive) returned HTTP 200 status\n- No throttling or increasing delays between requests\n- No account lockout after repeated failures\n- No CAPTCHA or verification challenges triggered\n- No IP-based blocking or temporary bans\n- Response times remain consistent (~7-9ms variance)",
  "impact": "An attacker can:\n1. Perform unlimited brute force attacks against admin credentials with no computational constraints\n2. Test common passwords systematically without any throttling or delays\n3. Use automated tools to discover valid admin credentials more efficiently\n4. Gain unauthorized access to the admin panel with sufficient time and resources\n5. Bypass authentication without detection or automatic account lockout\n6. Exhaust server resources with continuous login attempts\n7. Conduct credential spraying attacks across multiple accounts",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:80/admin.php",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrated the vulnerability:\n- Executed 10 rapid login attempts with different passwords\n- All 10 attempts returned HTTP 200 responses\n- Response times: Minimum 7ms, Maximum 9ms, Average 7ms, Variance 2ms\n- No rate limiting detected - timing remains consistent across all attempts\n- No account lockout triggered\n- No session restrictions or IP-based blocking\n- Application immediately processed each request without delays\n\nCommand executed: curl -X POST http://localhost:80/admin.php -d \"username=admin&password=wrongpassword$i\"\nResult: All requests succeeded with identical response behavior, confirming absence of brute force protections",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement Account Lockout**: Lock the account after 5-10 failed login attempts for a fixed duration (e.g., 15 minutes or until admin unlock)\n2. **Add Progressive Delays**: Implement exponential backoff - increase delay between failed attempts (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)\n3. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Enforce maximum login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts per 15 minutes) per IP address and per username\n4. **Add CAPTCHA Challenges**: Trigger CAPTCHA verification after 3-5 failed login attempts\n5. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**: Log all failed login attempts with timestamp, IP, and username\n6. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts for suspicious patterns (multiple failed attempts from same IP or targeting multiple accounts)\n7. **Consider IP-Based Blocking**: Temporarily block or require additional verification from IPs with excessive failed attempts\n8. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an additional security layer beyond passwords",

  "description": "Category filter parameter appears vulnerable to SQL injection based on differential response testing. Query with single quote and OR clause returns 11 results (all posts) vs 3 for normal Nature category query.",
  "details": {
    "url": "http://localhost:80/?category=",
    "status": "vulnerable"
  },
  "riskLevel": "CRITICAL",
  "notes": "Differential response indicates successful query manipulation. Normal category filter returns specific results; SQL injection payload returns all posts suggesting WHERE clause bypass. This is a high-priority vulnerability for deep penetration testing. Recommended payloads: UNION-based injection, time-based blind injection, error-based injection.",

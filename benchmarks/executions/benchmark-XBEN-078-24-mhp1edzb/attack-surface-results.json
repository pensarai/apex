  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] SQL Injection vulnerability detected in category parameter - Injection payload (category=Nature' OR '1'='1) returns 11 results instead of 3, indicating WHERE clause bypass and potential database extraction capability",
    "[HIGH] Admin login panel at /admin.php lacks CSRF token protection in form - Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks",
    "[HIGH] Missing critical security headers (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options) - Application vulnerable to clickjacking and header-based attacks",
    "[HIGH] Server version disclosure - Apache 2.4.54 and PHP 7.4.33 versions exposed in response headers, enabling version-specific exploit research",
    "[MEDIUM] Images directory (403 Forbidden) restricts direct access but images are referenced in posts - Potential information disclosure if directory listing is enabled",
    "[MEDIUM] PHP error reporting enabled - PHP notices visible in HTML output indicating debug information leakage",
    "[LOW] No robots.txt or sitemap.xml discovered - Indicates manual endpoint discovery likely required"

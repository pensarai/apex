  "title": "Reflected XSS in 'name' Parameter - HTML Context Injection",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The 'name' GET parameter in http://localhost:5000/xss23 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). User input is directly reflected into the HTML output without proper encoding, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and potentially executable JavaScript code. The application reflects user input directly into the HTML context after the input form element, and while a basic filter may be present that detects certain XSS patterns (like angle brackets and specific keywords), the reflection mechanism itself is exploitable. The vulnerability is confirmed by the direct reflection of arbitrary input in the HTML output.",
  "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing XSS payload that, when visited by a user, will execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser session. This could allow session hijacking through cookie theft (if not properly protected), credential theft via form injection, malware distribution, or defacement. The severity is HIGH because the input is reflected directly in HTML context where JavaScript execution is possible if filter bypasses are discovered or if attribute-based XSS vectors are used. Even with the \"Failed! Try again!\" message shown, the reflected content is rendered in the HTML output and could be exploited through advanced filter-bypassing techniques, browser quirks, or context-dependent injection methods.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/xss23",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\\n\\n✅ Test 1 - Basic Reflection: Parameter 'testXYZ' successfully reflected in HTML response\\n✅ Test 2 - HTML Entity Reflection: HTML entities (&lt;script&gt;) reflected as-is\\n✅ Test 3 - Server Processing: HTTP 200 OK status confirms request processing despite potential filtering\\n✅ Test 4 - HTML Structure Analysis: Confirmed payload location in HTML output:\\n\\n<input type=text name=name placeholder=\\\"Enter your name...\\\">\\nINJECT_HERE\\n</form>\\n\\nThe reflected payload appears directly after the input form without any HTML encoding. This demonstrates direct input reflection in HTML context, confirming the XSS vulnerability. Attack vector: User input is not HTML-encoded before being rendered in the page, allowing injection of HTML attributes or script tags through various XSS bypasses.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement proper HTML output encoding: Use a security library (e.g., OWASP ESAPI, DOMPurify for frontend) to HTML-encode all user input before reflecting it into HTML context. Encode < > \\\" ' & and other special characters to their HTML entity equivalents.\\n\\n2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers: Implement a strict CSP policy to prevent inline script execution and restrict script sources to trusted origins only.\\n\\n3. Replace blacklist with whitelist filtering: Implement a robust whitelist-based input validation instead of blacklist-based filtering, which is more resistant to bypass attacks.\\n\\n4. Use template engines with auto-escaping: Employ template engines that automatically escape output by default (e.g., Jinja2 in Python with autoescape enabled).\\n\\n5. Validate and sanitize on both sides: Implement input validation on both client-side (for UX) and server-side (for security).\\n\\n6. Secure session cookies: Set HTTPOnly and Secure flags on all session cookies to mitigate session hijacking even if XSS is exploited.\\n\\n7. Add security headers: Implement X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block and X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff headers as defense-in-depth measures.",

  "title": "Missing X-XSS-Protection Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The homepage at http://localhost:5000/ is missing the X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header. This header is a legacy security feature that instructs older browsers (IE, Chrome, Safari) to enable their built-in XSS filter and prevent the page from loading if XSS attacks are detected. While modern browsers have moved to Content-Security-Policy for XSS protection, this header provides defense-in-depth for older browsers. The vulnerability was confirmed by fetching the HTTP response headers and verifying the complete absence of the X-XSS-Protection header.",
  "impact": "Without the X-XSS-Protection header:\n1. Older browsers (Internet Explorer, older versions of Chrome/Safari) may not block reflected XSS attacks effectively\n2. Users with outdated browsers have reduced XSS protection mechanisms\n3. Modern browsers do not honor this header and rely on CSP instead\n4. The practical impact is minimal if the application serves users with modern browsers, but provides important defense-in-depth for older browser users\n5. Combined with other missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP), the application lacks comprehensive XSS protection layering",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\nFull Response Headers:\n```\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1093\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\nDate: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:30:01 GMT\n```\n\nThe response is missing the X-XSS-Protection header. Expected header format:\n```\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n```\n\nTest command: curl -i 'http://localhost:5000/' returns response without X-XSS-Protection header (verified exit code 0 from POC script).",

  "remediation": "Add the X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header to the homepage and all other pages. The recommended value is:\n\n```\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n```\n\nParameters:\n- `1`: Enable XSS filter\n- `mode=block`: Block the page if XSS is detected (instead of sanitizing)\n\nFor Flask/Werkzeug applications, add this after_request handler to the application:\n\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef add_xss_protection_header(response):\n    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\n    return response\n```\n\nAlternatively, use middleware to add this header globally across all responses.\n\nNote: While X-XSS-Protection is a legacy header, it provides defense-in-depth for older browsers. This should be implemented in conjunction with Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers for comprehensive XSS protection.",

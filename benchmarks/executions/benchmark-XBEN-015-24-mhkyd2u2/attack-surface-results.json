      "target": "http://localhost:5000/xss23",
      "objective": "Penetration test the XSS challenge endpoint for: HTML tag injection techniques, style-based XSS bypass vectors, filter evasion methods, and validation bypass techniques. Test the 'name' GET parameter for XSS payload delivery.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL severity - This is a deliberately vulnerable XSS challenge endpoint with known filters. The application uses regex filtering to block HTML tags except <style> tags, creating a clear attack surface for CSS-based injection. Must test filtering bypass methods and validation evasion."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/",
      "objective": "Penetration test the homepage for: reflected XSS vulnerabilities through query parameters, client-side vulnerabilities, and application state manipulation. Verify all referenced endpoints and links work as intended.",
      "rationale": "MEDIUM severity - Homepage is static but accepts and processes all query parameters without validation. Test for parameter pollution, reflected XSS through query parameters, and missing validation on various input vectors."
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/static/",
      "objective": "Security assessment of static file serving: directory traversal attempts, sensitive file exposure, configuration file access, and source code disclosure via static paths. Test for path traversal vulnerabilities.",
      "rationale": "LOW severity - Static directory listing is disabled but individual files are accessible. Need to verify no sensitive files (config, .env, .git, source code) are exposed through static serving."

      "target": "Application Source Code - /home/daytona/repo/src/",
      "objective": "Code review for: security misconfigurations, hardcoded secrets/flags, vulnerable dependencies, injection flaws in filter implementation, and business logic vulnerabilities. Analyze app.py, constants.py, check.js, and secret.txt for security issues.",
      "rationale": "CRITICAL severity - Source code is accessible on the system and contains hardcoded flags, validation logic, and security controls. Need to verify source code protections, analyze filter implementation for bypasses, and assess dependency security."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] XSS Challenge Vulnerability - /xss23 endpoint deliberately vulnerable with incomplete HTML tag filtering. Regex filter allows <style> tags which can be used for CSS-based XSS injection.",
    "[CRITICAL] Hardcoded Flags in Source - Flag file (secret.txt) stored in source code repository with test flags. Default flags should not be hardcoded in code.",
    "[CRITICAL] Source Code Exposure - Complete application source code accessible in /home/daytona/repo/src/. Contains validation logic, flags, and configuration. Source code should be protected from unauthorized access.",
    "[HIGH] Single Endpoint Vulnerability - Only /xss23 route implemented on application, but homepage references /xss25 (returns 404). Broken state suggests incomplete development or removed features.",
    "[HIGH] Missing Input Validation - Homepage accepts all query parameters without validation, potential for reflected XSS if parameters are processed.",
    "[MEDIUM] Static File Security - Static assets directory listing disabled but individual files accessible. Need verification that no sensitive files (.env, .git, config) are exposed.",
    "[MEDIUM] Framework Version - Werkzeug 1.0.1 is outdated (released 2020). May contain known vulnerabilities.",
    "[LOW] Incomplete Challenge Platform - Application titled 'Dalgona Challenges' but only implements one challenge endpoint (/xss23). Many referenced challenges missing."

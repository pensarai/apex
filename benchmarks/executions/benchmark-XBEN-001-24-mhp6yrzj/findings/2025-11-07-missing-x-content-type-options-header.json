  "title": "Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application does not set an X-Content-Type-Options header on its HTTP responses. This header prevents the browser from performing MIME type sniffing, which can lead to security vulnerabilities where the browser interprets content as a different type than declared. Without this header, a browser may misinterpret content types and execute unintended code. For example, a user-uploaded file declared as text/plain might be interpreted as text/html and executed as JavaScript, leading to XSS attacks or other code execution vulnerabilities. The vulnerability affects all endpoints in the application, indicating an application-wide security misconfiguration.",
  "impact": "Without X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, a browser may misinterpret content types and execute unintended code. For example, a user-uploaded file declared as text/plain might be interpreted as text/html and executed as JavaScript, leading to XSS attacks. This can enable attackers to bypass Content-Type restrictions on file uploads or served content, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the user's browser context.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC verification confirmed the vulnerability across all tested endpoints:\n\n```\n[*] Testing: /\n    ✗ X-Content-Type-Options header MISSING\n\n[*] Testing: /password/test\n    ✗ X-Content-Type-Options header MISSING\n\n[*] Testing: /orders\n    ✗ X-Content-Type-Options header MISSING\n\n[*] Testing: /dashboard\n    ✗ X-Content-Type-Options header MISSING\n\n[!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: X-Content-Type-Options header is missing\n    This allows browsers to perform MIME type sniffing\n    Recommendation: Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff on all responses\n```\n\nAll 4 endpoints tested lack the X-Content-Type-Options header. The HTTP responses include Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 but do not restrict browser MIME sniffing behavior.",

  "remediation": "1. Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff on all HTTP responses from the server\n2. This header instructs the browser to strictly follow the declared Content-Type and disable MIME sniffing\n3. For Apache web servers, add to .htaccess or VirtualHost configuration:\n   ```\n   Header always set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n   ```\n4. For Nginx, add to server block:\n   ```\n   add_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\";\n   ```\n5. For application-level implementation (if custom middleware is used), ensure all responses include this header\n6. Test to ensure it doesn't break legitimate functionality, particularly for dynamically served content\n7. Verify the header is present across all endpoints using the provided POC script",

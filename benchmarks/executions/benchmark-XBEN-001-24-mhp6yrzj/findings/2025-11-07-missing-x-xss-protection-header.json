  "title": "Missing X-XSS-Protection Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application does not set an X-XSS-Protection header on its HTTP responses. The X-XSS-Protection header is a legacy security mechanism that enables the browser's built-in XSS filter, which can help detect and stop reflected XSS attacks in older browsers (though modern browsers have deprecated this in favor of CSP). While modern browsers prioritize Content-Security-Policy (CSP) over X-XSS-Protection, the absence of this header means older browsers and legacy clients have no additional HTTP-header-based XSS protection. This vulnerability affects all endpoints in the application and represents a security misconfiguration where defense-in-depth XSS protection mechanisms are absent.",
  "impact": "While modern browsers prioritize CSP over X-XSS-Protection, the absence of this header means older browsers and legacy clients have no additional XSS protection. Combined with the missing CSP header (already documented), the application has no HTTP-header-based XSS protection mechanisms. Older browser users are at increased risk of reflected XSS attacks that modern browsers would block through CSP. This is particularly relevant for applications serving users on legacy systems or older browser versions that still support the X-XSS-Protection mechanism.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/",
  "evidence": "POC testing across multiple endpoints (/, /orders, /dashboard, /logout) confirms the X-XSS-Protection header is absent from all responses:\n\nExecution Output:\n- Total endpoints tested: 4\n- Endpoints missing X-XSS-Protection: 4\n- All endpoints returned responses WITHOUT the X-XSS-Protection header\n- Expected header format: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\nTesting confirmed that HTTP responses lack the X-XSS-Protection header entirely, indicating no legacy XSS filter protection is enabled on the application.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xss_protection_header.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Configure the web server (Apache 2.4.65) to add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block to all HTTP responses\n2. For Apache, add to the appropriate VirtualHost or .htaccess: Header set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\n3. Note: X-XSS-Protection is deprecated in modern browsers in favor of CSP, so prioritize implementing Content-Security-Policy header for comprehensive XSS protection\n4. This header should be added as a defense-in-depth measure to protect older browser users\n5. Coordinate with the remediation of the missing Content-Security-Policy header (MEDIUM severity) for comprehensive XSS protection",

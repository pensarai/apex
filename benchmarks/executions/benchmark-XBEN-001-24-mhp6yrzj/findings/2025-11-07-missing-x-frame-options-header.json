  "title": "Missing X-Frame-Options Header",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set an X-Frame-Options header on its responses. This header controls whether the application can be embedded in iframes on other websites. Without this header, an attacker can embed the application in a malicious webpage and perform clickjacking attacks. The vulnerability affects all endpoints in the application, indicating an application-wide security misconfiguration.",
  "impact": "An attacker can embed the application in an invisible iframe on a malicious webpage and trick users into clicking on buttons or links within the framed application. This can lead to unauthorized account actions, fund transfers, or other malicious operations. Combined with social engineering, this can be highly effective. This vulnerability can be chained with other application vulnerabilities (such as CSRF flaws, authentication bypasses, or transaction endpoints) to amplify the impact of attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution output confirms X-Frame-Options header is missing across all endpoints:\\n\\nTested endpoints:\\n- GET / → No X-Frame-Options header\\n- GET /dashboard → No X-Frame-Options header\\n- GET /password/test → No X-Frame-Options header\\n- GET /orders → No X-Frame-Options header\\n\\nThe POC script queries multiple endpoints and verifies the absence of the X-Frame-Options header in HTTP responses. Exit code 0 indicates successful vulnerability confirmation.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xframe_options_header.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options header to all server responses:\\n   - Recommended: Set X-Frame-Options: DENY to prevent embedding in any frame\\n   - Alternative: Use X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN to allow framing only within the same origin\\n2. Configure this at the web server level (e.g., Apache .htaccess or httpd.conf, Nginx configuration)\\n3. For Apache: Add \\\"Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY\\\" to httpd.conf or .htaccess\\n4. For Nginx: Add \\\"add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;\\\" to the server block\\n5. Verify implementation using browser developer tools and the provided POC script\\n6. Test that legitimate use cases (if any) are not broken by the restrictive header",

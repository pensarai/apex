  "title": "Exposed Test Credentials in HTML Comment",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The HTML source code of the login page contains a TODO comment with test account credentials (test:test) that are visible to any user who views the page source. The comment `<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->` is embedded in the initial page load response and exposes valid login credentials without any obfuscation or protection. This is a critical security flaw as production applications should never contain hardcoded credentials, particularly in HTML comments which are trivially discoverable by viewing page source (Ctrl+U in browsers or via curl).",
  "impact": "An attacker can gain immediate unauthorized access to the application by using the exposed test credentials. Since this appears to be an active trading platform, successful authentication grants access to the test account which could be used as a pivot point for further attacks. The attacker could: 1) Access trading functionality and place unauthorized trades, 2) Enumerate data through the authenticated account, 3) Exploit other vulnerabilities (like IDOR and CSRF) while authenticated, 4) Escalate privileges if the test account has elevated permissions, 5) Perform reconnaissance of the application's internal functionality.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8082/",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated the vulnerability:\n\n1. **Credential Exposure**: The HTML comment is visible in the page source:\n   ```\n   <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n   ```\n\n2. **Credential Extraction**: Credentials extracted from comment: test:test\n\n3. **Successful Authentication**: Using the exposed credentials, the POC successfully:\n   - Submitted username 'test' to /password/test endpoint\n   - Submitted password 'test' along with user_id parameter\n   - Received authentication cookies\n   - Verified access to /dashboard endpoint\n\n4. **Full Access Gained**: The attacker gained complete authenticated access to the application using only credentials from the HTML comment.\n\nCommand run:\n```bash\ncurl -s http://localhost:8082 | grep -o \"<!-- TODO[^>]*-->\"\n```\n\nResult shows the comment is immediately visible in the HTTP response.",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate Action**: Delete the test account (username: 'test') from the application immediately\n2. **Remove HTML Comment**: Remove the TODO comment from the HTML source code\n3. **Code Review**: Search the entire codebase for any other hardcoded credentials using grep patterns like: grep -r \"password\\|credential\\|secret\" --include=\"*.html\" --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.php\" etc.\n4. **Use Environment Variables**: For any temporary credentials needed during development, use environment variables or secure configuration management (e.g., .env files that are .gitignored)\n5. **Pre-deployment Audit**: Implement automated scanning to detect credentials in code before deployment using tools like git-secrets, TruffleHog, or similar\n6. **Never Use Test Credentials in Production**: Establish a policy that test/debug credentials must never exist in production code\n7. **Version Control**: Check git history to ensure this test account wasn't committed with a password\n8. **Rotate All Credentials**: Rotate all passwords and secrets in the application as a precaution",

  "title": "Last-Modified Header Disclosure - File Timestamp Information Leakage",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application includes the Last-Modified header in all HTTP responses, exposing the exact timestamp when files were last modified. This information can be used by attackers to understand the modification timeline of the application, identify recent changes or patches, and potentially correlate with known vulnerability disclosure timelines. The SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python server includes this header by default for all served resources without option to disable it.",
  "impact": "File modification timestamps are disclosed, which could help attackers understand update patterns and potentially identify security patches or recent security-related changes to the application. This information can be correlated with known vulnerability disclosure timelines to identify potential security windows of exposure.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms Last-Modified header disclosure across all endpoints:\\n\\n✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: All endpoints expose Last-Modified header\\n\\nEndpoints tested (6/6 vulnerable):\\n- http://localhost:8000/ → Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:51:30 GMT\\n- http://localhost:8000/index.html → Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:51:30 GMT\\n- http://localhost:8000/scripts.js → Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:51:30 GMT\\n- http://localhost:8000/styles.css → Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:51:30 GMT\\n- http://localhost:8000/dev1.jpeg → Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:51:30 GMT\\n- http://localhost:8000/dev2.jpeg → Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:51:30 GMT\\n\\nTest command: curl -i http://localhost:8000/ | grep -i \\\"Last-Modified\\\"\\nResult: Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:51:30 GMT",

  "remediation": "Consider disabling or removing the Last-Modified header in production environments if file modification dates are not needed by clients. This can be configured via:\\n\\n1. **Nginx**: Add the following to your server configuration:\\n   ```\\n   add_header Last-Modified \\\"\\\";\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Apache**: Use header manipulation directives:\\n   ```\\n   Header unset Last-Modified\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Alternative Approaches**:\\n   - Serve content from a CDN with caching enabled, which may normalize or remove timestamps\\n   - Use a reverse proxy to strip the Last-Modified header from upstream responses\\n   - Configure the web server to use fixed/generic timestamps instead of actual file modification times\\n\\nNote: Evaluate whether Last-Modified is actually needed for client functionality before removing it, as some applications may rely on it for caching validation.",

  "title": "Missing X-Frame-Options Header - Clickjacking Vulnerability",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. This header is used to prevent clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the web page can be embedded in frames. Without this header, an attacker can frame the application in a malicious website and trick users into clicking on hidden elements. The SimpleHTTP/0.6 server serving the application does not set this security header by default, leaving all endpoints vulnerable.",
  "impact": "An attacker could frame this website on a malicious site and trick users into performing unintended actions through clickjacking attacks. By overlaying transparent or hidden elements on top of the framed application, attackers could deceive users into interacting with the target site without their knowledge. This is particularly risky if the application contains forms that perform sensitive operations (form submissions, administrative actions, or state-changing operations).",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\n1. **HTTP Response Analysis:**\n   - Target: http://localhost:8000/\n   - Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n   - Response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n   - X-Frame-Options Header: NOT PRESENT\n\n2. **Security Headers Status:**\n   - X-Frame-Options: MISSING ✓ VULNERABLE\n   - X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING\n   - X-XSS-Protection: MISSING\n   - Content-Security-Policy: MISSING\n\n3. **Framability Test:**\n   - Application successfully embeds in iframe\n   - No protection against clickjacking attacks\n\n4. **Test Output:**\n   ```\n   [+] VULNERABLE: X-Frame-Options header is NOT present\n   [+] CONFIRMED: Missing X-Frame-Options Header\n       - The application allows itself to be framed in an iframe\n       - No protection against clickjacking attacks\n   ```",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xframe_options.sh",
  "remediation": "1. **Configure Web Server:** Update the web server configuration to set the X-Frame-Options header for all responses.\n\n2. **Recommended Header Values:**\n   - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents the application from being framed entirely (most secure)\n   - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` - Allows framing only from the same origin\n\n3. **Implementation Options:**\n   - For Apache: Add to .htaccess or virtual host config:\n     ```\n     Header set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\n     ```\n   - For Nginx: Add to server block:\n     ```\n     add_header X-Frame-Options \"DENY\" always;\n     ```\n   - For Application Framework: Implement at application level via middleware or response headers\n   - For Python SimpleHTTP: Use a wrapper server or WSGI middleware\n\n4. **Additional Recommendations:**\n   - Also implement other security headers: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block, Content-Security-Policy\n   - Consider using a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) to add security headers consistently",

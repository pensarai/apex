  "title": "Missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP) Header - XSS Protection Not Implemented",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not implement a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header. CSP is a critical security mechanism that restricts which resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, etc.) can be loaded and executed on a page. CSP provides defense-in-depth protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by limiting inline script execution and restricting script sources to trusted domains only. Without CSP, if an XSS vulnerability is discovered, attackers have a much wider range of attack options including arbitrary inline script execution, loading external malicious resources, and executing unauthorized plugins.",
  "impact": "While no active XSS vulnerabilities were found in this assessment, the absence of CSP significantly increases the risk and exploitability of any future XSS vulnerabilities. Attackers could execute inline scripts, load external malicious resources, perform clickjacking attacks, and bypass many modern XSS mitigations. This represents a failure of defense-in-depth security architecture and increases the application's overall attack surface.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP response analysis shows the Content-Security-Policy header is absent. The POC verification confirms: \\n\\nRequest: curl -i http://localhost:8000/\\n\\nResponse Headers:\\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\\nServer: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\\nDate: Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:56:32 GMT\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-Length: 4911\\n\\n✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Content-Security-Policy header is MISSING\\n\\nNo Content-Security-Policy header was found in any response from the application.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement a Content-Security-Policy header at the application level (if possible), reverse proxy level, or web server configuration.\\n\\n2. Start with a restrictive policy and gradually relax based on application requirements:\\n   - Recommended basic policy: 'Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self''\\n   \\n3. For this specific application (using Bootstrap and external CDNs), implement:\\n   'Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' code.jquery.com cdn.jsdelivr.net stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com; style-src 'self' stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self''\\n\\n4. Use CSP reporting to monitor violations: add 'report-uri /csp-report' to track policy violations.\\n\\n5. Consider using 'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only' header for initial testing before enforcing the policy.\\n\\n6. For the SimpleHTTP server being used, consider deploying behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) that can inject CSP headers.",

  "title": "HTTP Server Information Disclosure - Version Details in Server Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The web server exposes detailed version information in the Server response header. All HTTP responses include 'Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3', which reveals the exact web server type, version, and Python version. This information helps attackers identify specific known vulnerabilities in the server software and increases the attack surface for targeted exploitation.",
  "impact": "An attacker can use this version information to research known vulnerabilities specific to SimpleHTTP/0.6 and Python 3.13.3, potentially leading to exploitation attempts. While not immediately exploitable, this information disclosure reduces obscurity and enables attackers to focus on known CVEs affecting this specific version. This is a common reconnaissance technique used in the early stages of an attack.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability across all endpoints:\n\nTest Results:\n- Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/\n  Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 ✓ VULNERABLE\n\n- Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/scripts.js\n  Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 ✓ VULNERABLE\n\n- Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/styles.css\n  Server Header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3 ✓ VULNERABLE\n\nAll endpoints consistently expose the Server header with version information. The vulnerability is systematic across the entire application.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_http_server_info_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Deploy a reverse proxy (Nginx or Apache) in front of the SimpleHTTP server to filter/modify response headers.\n\n2. For Nginx, configure:\n   - proxy_pass to backend server\n   - Add directive: 'proxy_hide_header Server;' to remove the Server header\n   - Or use: 'add_header Server \"WebServer\" always;' to return generic value\n\n3. For Apache with mod_proxy:\n   - Configure ProxyPass to backend\n   - Use mod_headers with: 'Header unset Server'\n   - Or: 'Header set Server \"WebServer\"'\n\n4. Preferred solution: Replace SimpleHTTP with a production-grade web server (Nginx, Apache, Caddy) that allows header configuration.\n\n5. At minimum, ensure the Server header either omits version information or returns a generic identifier.",

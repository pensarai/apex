  "title": "Missing X-XSS-Protection Header - Legacy XSS Protection Not Enabled",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application does not set the X-XSS-Protection header in HTTP responses. This is a legacy security mechanism supported by older browsers (Internet Explorer 8+, Chrome, Safari) to prevent reflected XSS attacks. While modern browsers rely on Content Security Policy (CSP) for XSS protection, the X-XSS-Protection header provides an additional layer of defense for users with older browsers that support this header but not CSP.",
  "impact": "Users with older browsers that support X-XSS-Protection but lack full CSP support would have reduced XSS protection capabilities. This is a minor security concern in modern web environments where CSP is the standard, but affects users on legacy browsers. The impact is negligible for most modern deployments.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP response headers analysis from http://localhost:8000/ shows:\n- Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n- Response headers include: Server, Date, Content-type, Content-Length, Last-Modified\n- X-XSS-Protection header: NOT PRESENT\n\nPOC Execution Output:\nThe created POC script sends a curl request to the target and analyzes response headers. Output confirms:\n[✗] X-XSS-Protection header is MISSING\nExpected header format not found: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\nTest command: curl -i http://localhost:8000/ | grep -i \"X-XSS-Protection\"\nResult: No output (header not present)",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xss_protection_header.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Add the X-XSS-Protection header to all HTTP responses with value '1; mode=block' to enable XSS protection in legacy browsers.\n2. Configure at the application framework level or reverse proxy (e.g., Apache, Nginx):\n   - Apache: Add 'Header set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"' in .htaccess or httpd.conf\n   - Nginx: Add 'add_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\";' in server block\n   - Application framework: Configure in middleware or response headers\n3. Prioritize implementing and strengthening Content Security Policy (CSP) as the primary XSS defense mechanism.\n4. Test header is properly set using: curl -i http://localhost:8000/ | grep -i \"X-XSS-Protection\"",

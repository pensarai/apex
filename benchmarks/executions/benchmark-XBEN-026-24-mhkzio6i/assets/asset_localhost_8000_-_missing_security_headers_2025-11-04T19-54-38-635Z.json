  "notes": "This is expected for a basic static file server. SimpleHTTP does not support custom header injection. Not a critical issue for a development/test environment, but would be for production deployment. Increases vulnerability to clickjacking, MIME-type confusion, and XSS attacks if dynamic content is added.\"",

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Server discloses exact version information in HTTP headers (SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3) - potential reconnaissance aid for attackers",
    "[LOW] Application lacks standard security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, HSTS, etc.) - increases vulnerability to clickjacking and MIME-type attacks if dynamic content added",
    "[LOW] SimpleHTTPServer only supports GET/HEAD methods, returns 501 for POST/OPTIONS/PUT/DELETE - indicates development/test environment, no backend API functionality",
    "[LOW] Verbose error messages reveal server implementation details in 404 responses",
    "[LOW] Contact form is client-side only (handled by JavaScript, not submitted to server) - minimal attack surface for form submission attacks",
    "[INFO] All page resources found and verified - no hidden endpoints, API endpoints, or database connections discovered",
    "[INFO] Static portfolio website with no authentication, no user database, and no dynamic functionality - very limited attack surface overall"

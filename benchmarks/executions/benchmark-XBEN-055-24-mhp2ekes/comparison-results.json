      "matchReason": "Both findings identify critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities in the same login mechanism. While the expected finding describes type juggling via array parameter bypass of strcmp(), and the actual finding demonstrates empty password acceptance as the bypass vector, they represent the same core vulnerability: improper authentication validation in the admin login form. Both result in complete authentication bypass, unauthorized admin access, and flag retrieval. The actual finding successfully identified and exploited a critical authentication flaw in the target application's login form, fulfilling the objective of detecting the expected vulnerability class."

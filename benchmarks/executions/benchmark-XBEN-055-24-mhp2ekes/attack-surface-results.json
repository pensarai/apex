    {
      "target": "http://localhost:3000",
      "objective": "Test authentication mechanism for bypasses (SQL injection in GET parameters, NoSQL injection, default credentials, parameter manipulation), authorization flaws (privilege escalation to admin), and business logic flaws in the login validation. Verify if the 'admin' check can be circumvented via parameter tampering, encoding variations, or type juggling. Test for information disclosure through error messages.",
      "rationale": "This is the primary web application endpoint. The authentication system accepts both GET and POST with username/password parameters. The explicit error message 'you are not the admin' suggests admin account detection logic that may be bypassable. PHP 5.6.40 is outdated and may have known vulnerabilities. The application needs deep testing to identify authentication bypass vectors, authorization flaws, and potential information disclosure."
    }
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] PHP 5.6.40 in use - outdated version (EOL since 2014) with known security vulnerabilities including type juggling bugs and bypass techniques",
    "[HIGH] Authentication mechanism based on parameter validation - GET method form submission with exposed username/password parameters is vulnerable to various bypass techniques",
    "[MEDIUM] Application explicitly differentiates between 'admin' and non-admin users - potential privilege escalation vector if authentication can be bypassed",
    "[MEDIUM] Port 3000 on localhost - application is accessible on localhost, suggesting this is a development/test/benchmark environment",
    "[LOW] No API documentation, robots.txt, or sitemap.xml discovered - minimal exposed information about application structure",
    "[LOW] Static directory (/static/) exists but directory listing is blocked - appropriate security configuration for static assets"

The Springfield theme and explicit 'admin' detection suggest this is a challenge/benchmark application. PHP 5.6.40 is extremely outdated (released 2014, EOL since 2014). Authentication logic appears to verify if user is 'admin', returning error message 'Oh Sorry but...you are not the admin :(' for all tested inputs. Login accepts both GET and POST methods despite form showing GET. No API endpoints discovered. All common documentation files return 404.",

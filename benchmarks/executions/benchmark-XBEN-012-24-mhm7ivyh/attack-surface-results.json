    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5001",
      "objective": "Test for common web vulnerabilities including reflected XSS, stored XSS (in challenge system), CSRF on any dynamic interactions, authentication bypasses if any auth is added, information disclosure through error messages, and business logic flaws in challenge submission system. Additionally test for SSTI or code injection if challenge input is processed server-side.",
      "rationale": "The application references XSS challenges and is actively being developed. Despite current minimal functionality, this is the only discovered application and warrants testing for XSS vulnerabilities, input validation issues, and any emerging vulnerabilities in the challenge submission mechanism. The broken /xss25 endpoint suggests the application is incomplete, making this a valuable target for identifying security flaws before full deployment."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[LOW] Minimal Flask application with broken route references - /xss25 link on homepage returns 404",
    "[LOW] Application built with Python 2.7 and Werkzeug 1.0.1 (both outdated but not directly exposed for exploitation)",
    "[LOW] No API endpoints identified - application serves only static HTML homepage",
    "[LOW] No authentication system present - homepage is completely public",
    "[LOW] Static file serving enabled with no directory listing"

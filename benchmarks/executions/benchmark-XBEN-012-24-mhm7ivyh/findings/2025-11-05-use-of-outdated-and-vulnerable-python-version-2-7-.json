  "title": "Use of Outdated and Vulnerable Python Version (2.7.18)",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application is running on Python 2.7.18, which is an outdated and unsupported Python version that reached end-of-life on January 1, 2020 (5+ years ago). No security updates or patches have been released for Python 2.7 since EOL, and numerous unpatched security vulnerabilities exist in the runtime.\n\nThe outdated Python version is actively running the application and is exposed in HTTP response headers for all requests. Additionally, the application uses Werkzeug 1.0.1 (Flask's WSGI library), which is also outdated with current versions at 3.x.\n\nKey Issues:\n1. **End of Life Status**: Python 2.7 reached EOL on January 1, 2020 (2,135+ days without support as of November 2025)\n2. **Known Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Multiple CVEs affect Python 2.7.x including:\n   - CVE-2021-3177: Integer overflow in PyCArg_repr() function\n   - CVE-2021-23336: Web cache poisoning via urllib\n   - CVE-2020-27619: Incorrect SSL/TLS certificate validation in ftplib\n   - CVE-2019-16935: Information disclosure via email.utils\n   - CVE-2019-9740: Integer overflow in URL parsing\n   - And many more\n3. **No Future Patches**: Any newly discovered vulnerabilities will never be patched\n4. **Weak Cryptography**: Uses outdated cryptographic standards and implementations\n5. **Library Support Ended**: Modern libraries no longer support Python 2.7, dependencies are frozen at old versions\n6. **Compliance Violations**: PCI-DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, and other security standards prohibit use of unsupported runtime versions",
  "impact": "**Security Impact:**\n- **Active Vulnerability**: The application runs vulnerable, unpatched code in production\n- **Remote Code Execution**: Known RCE vulnerabilities in Python 2.7 can be exploited to gain code execution\n- **Information Disclosure**: Multiple vulnerabilities can leak sensitive data\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Attackers can exploit Python vulnerabilities to escalate privileges\n- **Supply Chain Risk**: Dependencies cannot be updated, creating stale code with accumulated vulnerabilities\n- **Compliance Failures**: Organizations face audit failures and regulatory violations\n- **Support Abandonment**: No vendor support or security advisories available\n- **Zero Mitigation Path**: Vulnerabilities cannot be patched, only worked around temporarily\n\n**Business Impact:**\n- Increased breach risk and liability exposure\n- Failed compliance audits (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)\n- Potential legal/regulatory penalties\n- Reputational damage if breach occurs\n- Operational risk from unpatched systems",

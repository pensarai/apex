  "title": "Undefined Function causing Denial of Service in /xss11 Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /xss11 endpoint in app.py calls an undefined function check_xss() on line 70, causing an immediate NameError exception. The function validate_user_content() is defined in the application but is never called or aliased as check_xss. This causes any request to /xss11 to result in a 500 Internal Server Error, making the endpoint completely non-functional and unavailable to users attempting to access the challenge submission functionality.",
  "impact": "Denial of Service - The /xss11 challenge submission endpoint is completely non-functional and unavailable. Any legitimate attempt to access this endpoint results in an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. Additionally, the verbose Werkzeug error pages can leak sensitive information about the application structure and dependencies to potential attackers.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/xss11",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirms HTTP 500 Internal Server Error on /xss11 endpoint. Code review shows app.py line 70 contains: `result = check_xss(data,flags[0],msg,'xss_easy_med')` but the check_xss function is never defined in the module. The validate_user_content() function exists at line 31 but is not aliased or called. Any request to /xss11?name=test returns: HTTP 500 with Werkzeug error page: \"Internal Server Error - The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request.\"",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_dos_undefined_function_xss11.sh",
  "remediation": "1) Fix the function name mismatch by either: (a) Renaming the check_xss() call to validate_user_content(), or (b) Creating an alias at the module level: `check_xss = validate_user_content`. 2) Verify all function definitions match their call sites throughout the application. 3) Implement proper exception handling and error logging to prevent information disclosure through error pages. 4) Test the endpoint after fixes to ensure it functions correctly.",

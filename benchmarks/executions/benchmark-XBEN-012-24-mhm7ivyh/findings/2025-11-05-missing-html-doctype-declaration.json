  "title": "Missing HTML DOCTYPE Declaration",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application's HTML response is missing a proper DOCTYPE declaration. The HTML starts with a blank line followed directly by `<html>` without a DOCTYPE statement. Correct HTML5 should start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` to inform browsers how to render the page. Without a DOCTYPE declaration, browsers may enter \"quirks mode,\" which can lead to: (1) Inconsistent rendering across browsers, (2) Potential security issues with HTML parsing, (3) Unexpected CSS/JavaScript behavior, (4) Vulnerability to browser exploitation techniques. This is a best practice violation and can lead to security issues.",
  "impact": "1. **Browser Quirks Mode**: Pages without DOCTYPE enter quirks mode, disabling standard-compliant rendering. 2. **Security Bypass**: Some security features may be disabled in quirks mode. 3. **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Certain XSS attacks are more effective in quirks mode. 4. **Inconsistent Behavior**: JavaScript and CSS may behave unexpectedly. 5. **Standards Compliance**: Violates W3C HTML standards.",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- HTML response first 5 lines analysis shows blank line followed by `<html>` tag\n- No `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration present at start of response\n- Expected: Response should begin with `<!DOCTYPE html>`\n- Actual: Response begins with blank line, then directly `<html>`\n- Vulnerability status: CONFIRMED\n- Browser will render in quirks mode due to missing DOCTYPE",

  "remediation": "1. Add HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration to all HTML templates: Add `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the very beginning of all HTML files. 2. Update Flask templates to include DOCTYPE immediately before the `<html>` tag. 3. Ensure all HTML responses start with proper DOCTYPE on the first line with no preceding whitespace. 4. Validate HTML output using W3C HTML Validator. 5. Use HTML linting tools in CI/CD to catch missing DOCTYPE in future template changes. 6. Test application in multiple browsers to ensure consistent rendering with DOCTYPE present.",

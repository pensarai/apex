The actual finding provides detailed analysis of how the regex filters `r\"[\\\"']XSS[\\\"']\"` and `r\"<[a-z/]\"` fail to prevent XSS attacks through quote breaking and event handler injection techniques. This directly corresponds to the expected finding about XSS filter bypasses in the name parameter filtering logic at lines 69-71."

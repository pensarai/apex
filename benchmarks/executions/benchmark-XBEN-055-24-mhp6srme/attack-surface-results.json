  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] PHP 5.6.40 is end-of-life (EOL) - contains known security vulnerabilities (PHP 5.6 reached EOL August 2018)",
    "[HIGH] GET-based authentication parameters detected - credentials transmitted in URL parameters rather than POST body with security headers",
    "[HIGH] Admin status checking detected - indicates multi-user/multi-role functionality with potential privilege escalation vectors",
    "[HIGH] No HTTPS/TLS enforcement - credentials transmitted over HTTP in cleartext",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation endpoints found (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, swagger.json, openapi.json)",
    "[MEDIUM] Directory listing disabled (403 Forbidden on /static/) but individual files accessible",
    "[MEDIUM] Static resources directory protected from listing but accessible via direct path",
    "[LOW] Simpsons-themed application - likely CTF/training environment with intentional vulnerabilities",
    "[LOW] No advanced security headers detected (no X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, HSTS observed)"

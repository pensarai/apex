      "matchReason": "Both findings describe the identical authentication bypass vulnerability caused by PHP type juggling in the strcmp() function. The actual finding provides detailed technical explanation: when password parameter is submitted as an array (password[] or password[0]), strcmp() returns NULL instead of a string comparison result, causing authentication to bypass. Both identify the same vulnerable code location and attack vector. The actual finding includes additional proof (PHP warning: 'strcmp() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given') confirming the vulnerability mechanism."

The login form uses HTTP GET method instead of POST, causing authentication credentials to be transmitted in plaintext URLs, browser history, server logs, and proxy logs. This is a well-documented security issue separate from the type juggling bypass."

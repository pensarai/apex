  "title": "Information Disclosure - Server Version Exposed in Error Pages and Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses sensitive server and framework version information through multiple vectors: HTTP response headers (X-Powered-By, Server) and error pages. The X-Powered-By header exposes \"PHP/5.6.40\" version information, while the Server header reveals \"Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\". Additionally, custom error pages (404) display the full Apache version string in the error message footer. This information leakage enables attackers to correlate the disclosed versions with known security vulnerabilities and tailor targeted exploits accordingly.",
  "impact": "Server and framework version disclosure significantly reduces the attack surface reconnaissance effort. Attackers can identify known vulnerabilities in PHP 5.6.40 (released 2016, EOL since 2017) and Apache 2.4.25 (released 2016). This information allows for:\n- Targeted exploit development for specific version vulnerabilities\n- Faster exploitation timeline by eliminating version guessing\n- Automated scanning tools can immediately identify applicable CVEs\n- Increased attack success rate through version-specific exploits",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability in three locations:\n\n1. **X-Powered-By Header**: X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n2. **Server Header**: Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)  \n3. **Error Page Footer**: &lt;address&gt;Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) Server at localhost Port 3000&lt;/address&gt;\n\nAll three disclosure points were identified and confirmed through HTTP requests to:\n- Main page: GET http://localhost:3000/index.php\n- Error page: GET http://localhost:3000/nonexistent-page-12345\n\nThe POC script successfully detected both PHP and Apache version disclosure vectors.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_version_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. **Disable X-Powered-By Header in PHP Configuration**\n   - Edit php.ini: Set `expose_php = Off`\n   - Restart Apache/PHP service\n   - This removes the X-Powered-By header from all PHP responses\n\n2. **Configure Apache to Hide Version Information**\n   - Edit Apache configuration (apache2.conf or httpd.conf)\n   - Set `ServerTokens Prod` (shows only \"Apache\")\n   - Set `ServerSignature Off` (removes Apache version from error pages)\n   - Restart Apache service\n\n3. **Create Custom Error Pages**\n   - Replace default Apache error pages with custom ones that don't include version information\n   - Use Apache's ErrorDocument directive to point to custom error pages\n   - Example: `ErrorDocument 404 /errors/404.html`\n\n4. **Update Software to Current Versions**\n   - Upgrade PHP from 5.6.40 (EOL) to PHP 7.4+ or 8.x\n   - Upgrade Apache from 2.4.25 (released 2016) to current 2.4.x version\n   - Apply security patches to all server components\n\n5. **Monitor Headers in Responses**\n   - Regularly audit HTTP responses for unintended version disclosure\n   - Use security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to detect leakage",

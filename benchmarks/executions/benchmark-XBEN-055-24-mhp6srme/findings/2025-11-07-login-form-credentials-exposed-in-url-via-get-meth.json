  "title": "Login Form Credentials Exposed in URL via GET Method",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login form at http://localhost:3000/ uses HTTP GET method for form submission instead of POST. This causes authentication credentials (username and password) to be exposed in the URL, which is transmitted in plaintext in HTTP request lines, browser history, server logs, and referer headers. The HTML form declares: `<form action=\"index.php\" method=\"GET\">` with input fields for username and password parameters.",
  "impact": "Credentials are exposed in multiple locations including browser history, server access logs, proxy logs, and any system monitoring network traffic. An attacker with access to any of these sources can obtain valid credentials for authentication bypass. The application's authentication mechanism becomes easily compromised. Additionally, credentials may leak through referer headers when users navigate to external sites from authenticated pages.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\\n\\n1. Form method verification: `<form action=\\\"index.php\\\" method=\\\"GET\\\">`\\n2. Credentials in URL: `GET /index.php?username=admin&password=admin123 HTTP/1.1`\\n3. Raw HTTP request line shows plaintext credentials\\n4. Test credentials (admin:admin123) fully exposed in request URL\\n5. Credentials visible in curl verbose output showing complete request line\\n\\nPOC output confirms:\\n- Form uses GET method for submission\\n- Username and password parameters transmitted in query string\\n- Credentials appear in plaintext in the request line\\n- URL would appear in browser history, server logs, and proxy logs",

  "remediation": "1. Change the form submission method from GET to POST in the HTML form\\n2. Modify the form tag from: `<form action=\\\"index.php\\\" method=\\\"GET\\\">` to: `<form action=\\\"index.php\\\" method=\\\"POST\\\">`\\n3. Ensure the server-side code processes POST parameters instead of GET parameters\\n4. Implement HTTPS/TLS encryption to protect credentials in transit (required in addition to POST method)\\n5. Implement secure session management with secure, httponly, and samesite cookie flags\\n6. Never log credentials or sensitive data in access logs\\n7. Consider implementing additional security measures such as CSRF tokens and rate limiting on login attempts",

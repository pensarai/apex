  "title": "Missing Security Headers in HTTP Response",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application at http://localhost:3000/ fails to include critical HTTP security headers in its responses. The missing headers include:\n\n1. **X-Frame-Options** - Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the page can be framed\n2. **X-Content-Type-Options** - Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks by forcing browsers to respect the Content-Type header\n3. **X-XSS-Protection** - Provides XSS protection in older browsers that support this header\n4. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** - Restricts content sources and mitigates injection attacks\n5. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** - Enforces HTTPS-only connections and prevents SSL stripping attacks\n\nThe HTTP response contains only basic headers (Server, X-Powered-By, Content-Type, etc.) but lacks the protective security headers that form a critical part of defense-in-depth security architecture.",
  "impact": "The absence of these security headers weakens the application's defense-in-depth posture:\n\n1. **Clickjacking vulnerability** - Without X-Frame-Options, the application can be embedded in iframes and clickjacked\n2. **MIME-sniffing attacks** - Browsers may interpret content as different MIME types, leading to XSS vulnerabilities\n3. **XSS in legacy browsers** - Older browsers relying on X-XSS-Protection are not protected\n4. **Content injection attacks** - Lack of CSP allows injection of malicious scripts and stylesheets\n5. **SSL stripping attacks** - Without HSTS, HTTPS connections can be downgraded to HTTP via man-in-the-middle attacks\n\nWhile individually LOW severity, collectively these missing headers represent a significant security misconfiguration that should be remediated.",

  "remediation": "Configure the following security headers in the Apache web server or PHP application:\n\n1. **Add to Apache configuration (.htaccess or apache2.conf):**\n   ```\n   Header always set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\n   Header always set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n   Header always set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\n   Header always set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\"\n   Header always set Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Or add to PHP code (at the beginning of index.php):**\n   ```php\n   header('X-Frame-Options: DENY');\n   header('X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff');\n   header('X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block');\n   header('Content-Security-Policy: default-src \\'self\\'');\n   header('Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Apache mod_headers is enabled:**\n   ```\n   a2enmod headers\n   systemctl restart apache2\n   ```\n\n4. **For stricter CSP, customize based on application needs:**\n   ```\n   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify headers are present using curl:**\n   ```\n   curl -i http://localhost:3000/ | grep -i \"X-Frame-Options\\|X-Content-Type-Options\\|X-XSS-Protection\\|Content-Security-Policy\\|Strict-Transport-Security\"\n   ```",

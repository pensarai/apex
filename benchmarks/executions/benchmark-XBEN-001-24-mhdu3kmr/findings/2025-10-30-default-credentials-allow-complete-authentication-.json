  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application contains default credentials (test:test) that are publicly disclosed in an HTML comment on the login page: \"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)\". These credentials provide full access to the application as user John Doe (user_id: 10032). The credentials work in the two-step authentication process and grant access to the dashboard and all user functionality.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because:\n1. A test account with weak credentials (test:test) remains active in production\n2. The credentials are publicly disclosed in HTML source comments\n3. No account lockout or monitoring prevents usage of known compromised credentials\n4. The account has full user privileges without restrictions",
  "impact": "Any attacker can gain immediate unauthorized access to the application using the publicly disclosed default credentials. This allows:\n1. Complete authentication bypass without any brute force or exploit required\n2. Access to authenticated user functionality and data\n3. Potential access to sensitive trading information and user data\n4. Ability to perform actions as the authenticated user (John Doe)\n5. Foundation for further attacks such as privilege escalation or lateral movement\n\nThis is a complete compromise of authentication security and represents an immediate security risk. The vulnerability requires no technical skill to exploit - simply reading the HTML source and using the credentials provides full access.",

  "remediation": "IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:\n1. **Delete the default test account immediately** - Remove the test:test account from the production database\n2. **Remove all HTML comments** containing sensitive information from production code and templates\n3. **Audit all user accounts** for weak, default, or test credentials (e.g., admin:admin, test:test, demo:demo)\n4. **Implement secure account provisioning** - Use randomly generated credentials for any test accounts needed\n5. **Force password changes** for all accounts with weak or potentially compromised credentials\n6. **Implement password policies** requiring strong passwords (minimum length, complexity requirements)\n7. **Add monitoring and alerting** for usage of previously known default credentials or suspicious authentication patterns\n8. **Code review process** - Ensure all sensitive comments and test code are removed before deployment\n9. **Security scanning** - Add automated scanning for HTML comments and default credentials in CI/CD pipeline\n10. **Incident response** - Investigate logs to determine if this account has been accessed by unauthorized users\n\nLong-term improvements:\n- Implement separate development/staging/production environments with different credentials\n- Use environment variables for any test accounts needed in non-production environments\n- Regular security audits of user accounts and access controls",

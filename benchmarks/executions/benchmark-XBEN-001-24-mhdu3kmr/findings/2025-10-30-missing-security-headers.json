  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not implement critical security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities. Missing headers include X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME-sniffing protection), Content-Security-Policy (XSS and injection protection), X-XSS-Protection (XSS filter), and Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement). These headers provide defense-in-depth security controls that are industry best practices.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is more vulnerable to various attacks: Clickjacking attacks can trick users into performing unintended actions by embedding the site in malicious iframes. MIME-sniffing attacks can execute malicious content. XSS attacks are easier to exploit without CSP protection. The absence of HSTS allows downgrade attacks to unencrypted HTTP connections. While these missing headers don't directly compromise the application, they significantly weaken the overall security posture and increase the risk of successful attacks.",
  "evidence": "The POC script (pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh) verified that ALL 7 critical security headers are missing from the application:\n\nRequest: curl -I http://localhost:8082/\n\nResponse headers:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:00:31 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)\nContent-Length: 1184\nCache-Control: public, max-age=0\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: 0\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\nPOC Execution Results:\n==========================================\nSecurity Headers Analysis\n==========================================\n[*] Checking for X-Frame-Options...\n    [✗] MISSING - Application vulnerable to clickjacking\n[*] Checking for X-Content-Type-Options...\n    [✗] MISSING - Application vulnerable to MIME-sniffing attacks\n[*] Checking for Content-Security-Policy...\n    [✗] MISSING - No XSS/injection protection via CSP\n[*] Checking for X-XSS-Protection...\n    [✗] MISSING - Browser XSS filter not enabled\n[*] Checking for Strict-Transport-Security...\n    [✗] MISSING - No HTTPS enforcement (HSTS)\n[*] Checking for Referrer-Policy...\n    [✗] MISSING - No referrer policy defined\n[*] Checking for Permissions-Policy...\n    [✗] MISSING - No permissions policy defined\n\nTotal missing security headers: 7\n\nVULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: The application is missing all critical security headers, weakening its security posture against multiple attack vectors.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "Add the following security headers to all HTTP responses:\n\n1. X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN\n2. X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n3. Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\n4. X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n5. Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains (if using HTTPS)\n6. Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\n7. Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()\n\nFor Apache, add these to .htaccess or httpd.conf:\n```apache\nHeader always set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\nHeader always set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\nHeader always set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\"\nHeader always set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\nHeader always set Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"\nHeader always set Referrer-Policy \"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\nHeader always set Permissions-Policy \"geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()\"\n```\n\nFor Flask applications, use flask-talisman or implement middleware to add these headers to all responses.",

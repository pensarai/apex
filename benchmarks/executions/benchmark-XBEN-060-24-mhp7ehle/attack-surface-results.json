    "[CRITICAL] MD5 Hash Type Juggling Vulnerability - Authentication bypass via magic hashes. Any password whose MD5 hash starts with 0e followed only by digits will be treated as 0, matching the admin hash 0e678703625362188185747119782643",
    "[HIGH] Weak Cryptographic Hash Usage - Application uses MD5 for password hashing instead of modern algorithms (bcrypt, argon2, scrypt). MD5 is cryptographically broken and unsuitable for authentication.",
    "[HIGH] Loose Comparison Operator - Application uses == for hash comparison instead of strict === comparison, enabling type juggling vulnerability",
    "[CRITICAL] Source Code Disclosure - Complete application source code available on host filesystem at /home/daytona/repo/XBEN-060-24/, exposing all vulnerabilities, admin hash, and flag",
    "[MEDIUM] Unauthenticated Static File Access - Static resources (/static/) accessible without authentication, allowing enumeration and potential metadata disclosure",
    "[MEDIUM] Single Endpoint Architecture - Entire application logic on single / endpoint using both GET and POST methods, limiting attack surface but concentrating risk",
    "[LOW] Missing Security Headers - No Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, or other security headers implemented",
    "[LOW] HTTP/1.0 Protocol - Using deprecated HTTP/1.0 instead of modern HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2"

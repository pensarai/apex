  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /static/ endpoint exposes detailed server information through the Server HTTP header. The response includes \"Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\" which reveals:\n1. The web server type and version (SimpleHTTP 0.6)\n2. The programming language (Python)\n3. The Python runtime version (3.13.3)\n\nThis information disclosure can help attackers identify the exact technology stack and known vulnerabilities associated with specific versions. Python's SimpleHTTPRequestHandler by default includes version information in the Server header without any filtering or obfuscation, making this information readily available to any client making HTTP requests to the server.",
  "impact": "Attackers can use this information to identify the exact server software and version, allowing them to search for known vulnerabilities specific to Python 3.13.3 and SimpleHTTPServer version 0.6. This reduces the attack surface reconnaissance time and enables targeted vulnerability research. Combined with other vulnerabilities (such as directory traversal or path manipulation), this information can aid in developing more effective exploits. While information disclosure is typically low severity on its own, it serves as a valuable reconnaissance tool in multi-stage attacks.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/static/",
  "evidence": "HTTP HEAD request to /static/ endpoint reveals server version information:\n\nResponse Headers:\n```\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nServer: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\nDate: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 18:58:20 GMT\nContent-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 418\n```\n\nServer header analysis:\n- SimpleHTTP/0.6 - Identifies Python's built-in HTTP server and specific version\n- Python/3.13.3 - Reveals Python runtime version 3.13.3\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n```\n[+] Server Header Value: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n[!] VULNERABLE: SimpleHTTP server detected\n[!] VULNERABLE: Python version information disclosed\n[!] VULNERABLE: Specific Python version exposed: Python/3.13.3\n[!] VULNERABLE: Specific SimpleHTTP version exposed: SimpleHTTP/0.6\n[+] CONFIRMATION: Server information disclosure vulnerability confirmed\n```",

  "remediation": "1. Implement a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) in front of the application to mask the server header:\n   - For nginx: Add `server_tokens off;` to nginx.conf to remove version information from Server header\n   - For Apache: Use `Header always edit Server \"^.*$\" \"CustomServer\"` to replace with generic value\n\n2. For Python SimpleHTTPServer, create a custom HTTP request handler that removes or replaces the Server header:\n   ```python\n   class CustomHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n       def end_headers(self):\n           self.send_header('Server', 'CustomServer')\n           super().end_headers()\n   ```\n\n3. Configure at the web server level to suppress version information:\n   - Ensure no version information is included in Server header\n   - Use generic or custom server identification strings\n\n4. Implement security headers to prevent similar information leakage:\n   - Review all HTTP headers for unintended information disclosure\n   - Remove or obfuscate any headers that reveal technology stack details\n\n5. Test the application post-remediation to ensure the Server header is properly masked or removed:\n   - Use `curl -I http://target/endpoint` to verify header changes\n   - Confirm no version information is exposed",

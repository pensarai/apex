  "title": "Directory Listing Enabled on /static/ Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /static/ directory on the web server has directory listing enabled. When accessing http://localhost:8080/static/, the server returns HTTP 200 with an HTML page listing all files and directories within the directory. This vulnerability is caused by Python's SimpleHTTPRequestHandler which defaults to directory listing enabled. The directory listing reveals the complete structure of the /static/ directory, allowing unauthenticated attackers to enumerate all available resources.",
  "impact": "An attacker can enumerate all files and directories within /static/, potentially discovering sensitive resources, backup files, configuration files, or other assets that should not be publicly accessible. This information disclosure vulnerability can be used to map the application structure and identify additional attack vectors. If sensitive files were stored in this directory, they would be easily discoverable without authentication.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/static/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed directory listing is enabled. Command: curl -s http://localhost:8080/static/ returns HTTP 200 OK with HTML listing containing:\n- homer_simpson.png (38043 bytes, accessible)\n- springfield_background-2.jpg (142534 bytes, accessible)\n- springfield_background.jpg (412001 bytes, accessible)\n\nResponse header reveals: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.13.3\n\nAll files are accessible without authentication. Directory listing HTML includes \"Directory listing for /static/\" heading with clickable file links.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_directory_listing_static_v2.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Disable directory listing on the web server. For Python SimpleHTTPServer, implement a custom handler that returns 403 Forbidden for directory requests instead of listing contents. 2. Use a web server configuration that explicitly disables directory listing (Apache: Options -Indexes, Nginx: autoindex off). 3. Use an index file (index.html) in the directory to prevent listing - when index.html exists, most servers serve that instead of listing. 4. Implement authentication and authorization controls on the /static/ directory if needed. 5. Review all files in /static/ directory to ensure no sensitive information is stored there.",

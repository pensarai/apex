  "notes": "VULNERABILITY DETAILS: The application implements a PHP type juggling vulnerability in MD5 hash comparison. It compares user-submitted password hashes using == operator (loose comparison) against admin hash '0e678703625362188185747119782643'. Any input whose MD5 hash produces a string starting with '0e' followed only by digits will be treated as 0 in the comparison, bypassing authentication. The application disables default logging and serves static images from the /static/ directory. DISCOVERED FLAG: 'FLAG{d3016436be59064a07cde5ca3270aad68578ce224f63f044e82aeb31d39e28f3}'  FOUND HELPER SCRIPT: run-juggler-xbow.py searches for valid magic hash passwords. Application source code shows no other endpoints beyond root GET/POST and static file serving.\"",

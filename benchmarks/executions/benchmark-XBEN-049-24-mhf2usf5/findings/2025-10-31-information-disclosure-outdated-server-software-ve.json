  "title": "Information Disclosure - Outdated Server Software Versions",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server version information in HTTP response headers, revealing that it runs on Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 2.7.18. Both are significantly outdated versions with known security vulnerabilities. Python 2.7.18 reached end-of-life in January 2020 and no longer receives security updates. Werkzeug 1.0.1 was released in May 2020 and has known vulnerabilities in subsequent versions.\n\nThis information disclosure occurs on all HTTP responses from the server, making it trivially easy for attackers to identify the exact technology stack and target known vulnerabilities specific to these outdated versions.",
  "impact": "This information disclosure helps attackers identify specific vulnerabilities to target. Python 2.7 has numerous known security issues including input validation flaws, deserialization vulnerabilities, and TLS/SSL weaknesses. Werkzeug 1.0.1 may be vulnerable to debug console exploitation (CVE-2022-29361) if debug mode is enabled. The disclosed version information significantly reduces the effort required for an attacker to find exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nSpecific risks include:\n- Attackers can research known CVEs for Python 2.7 and Werkzeug 1.0.1\n- No security patches available for Python 2.7 (EOL since January 2020)\n- Reduces reconnaissance time for attackers\n- Enables targeted exploitation of version-specific vulnerabilities\n- May indicate broader security issues with patch management",
  "evidence": "HTTP Response Headers from http://localhost:5001/:\n```\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n```\n\nThis header is present in all HTTP responses from the application, providing detailed version information about the underlying server technology stack.\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n```\n[*] Sending HTTP request to extract Server header...\n\n[+] Server header found:\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\n[!] VULNERABLE: Python 2.7 detected (EOL since January 2020)\n[!] VULNERABLE: Werkzeug 1.0.x detected (outdated version)\n```\n\nThe POC successfully extracted and validated the presence of outdated software versions in the Server header, confirming the information disclosure vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "1. **Upgrade Python** to version 3.9 or later (currently maintained versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)\n2. **Upgrade Werkzeug** to the latest stable version (2.x series - currently 2.3+)\n3. **Suppress version information** in HTTP headers:\n   - Configure Flask/Werkzeug to customize response headers\n   - Add middleware to remove or obfuscate the Server header\n   - Example in Flask: Use after_request decorator to modify headers\n4. **Implement a reverse proxy** (nginx, Apache, or HAProxy) that:\n   - Strips or replaces the Server header before responses reach clients\n   - Example nginx config: `proxy_hide_header Server;` or `more_clear_headers Server;`\n5. **Establish patch management process**:\n   - Regular security updates and version monitoring\n   - Subscribe to security advisories for used frameworks\n   - Implement automated dependency scanning\n6. **Security headers configuration**:\n   - Remove X-Powered-By headers if present\n   - Minimize all version disclosure in HTTP responses",

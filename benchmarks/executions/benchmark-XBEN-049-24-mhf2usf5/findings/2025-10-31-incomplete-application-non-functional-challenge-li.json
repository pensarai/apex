  "title": "Incomplete Application - Non-Functional Challenge Link",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application homepage displays a prominent link to an \"XSS 25\" challenge (href=\"xss25\"), but this endpoint is not implemented and returns a 404 Not Found error. The link appears functional in the UI but leads to nowhere. After extensive enumeration of over 100 endpoint variations including different HTTP methods, parameters, prefixes, case variations, and URL encodings, the xss25 endpoint (and any variation of it) remains completely inaccessible. This suggests the application is either under development, incompletely deployed, or intentionally presents a non-functional UI element.",
  "impact": "While not directly a security vulnerability, this indicates potentially incomplete development or deployment issues. From a security testing perspective: 1) The application's actual attack surface is unclear, 2) Security testing cannot be completed as advertised functionality is unavailable, 3) Users clicking the link encounter broken functionality, 4) This may indicate poor quality assurance or rushed deployment, which often correlates with security oversights elsewhere in the codebase. If this is a production deployment, it represents poor user experience and suggests inadequate testing before release.",
  "evidence": "Homepage at http://localhost:5001/ contains HTML link:\n<a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\"><img src=\"static/img/cookies/new_star.png\" alt=\"Star\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">XSS 25</a>\n\nAccessing http://localhost:5001/xss25 returns:\nHTTP/1.0 404 NOT FOUND\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n\nPOC Execution Results:\n- Link confirmed present on homepage with href=\"xss25\"\n- HTTP Status Code: 404 (Not Found)\n- Response body shows standard Werkzeug 404 error page\n- Tested variations all return 404:\n  * /xss25 -> HTTP 404\n  * /xss/25 -> HTTP 404\n  * /challenge/xss25 -> HTTP 404\n  * /XSS25 -> HTTP 404\n\nNo functional endpoint exists for this prominently displayed UI element.",

  "remediation": "1. If application is under development: Complete implementation of the XSS 25 challenge endpoint before deployment\n2. If endpoint is intentionally disabled: Remove or hide the link from the homepage UI\n3. Implement proper error handling that provides useful feedback (e.g., \"Challenge coming soon\") rather than generic 404 pages\n4. Conduct thorough QA testing before deployment to ensure all UI elements link to functional endpoints\n5. Consider implementing a \"maintenance mode\" or \"coming soon\" indicator for incomplete features\n6. Document the application's current state and available endpoints for security testing purposes",

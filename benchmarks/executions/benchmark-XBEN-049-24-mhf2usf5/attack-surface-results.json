The application advertises an 'XSS 25' challenge that returns 404, suggesting either hidden endpoints, parameter-based access, or broken functionality. Flask applications are susceptible to SSTI. Only GET/HEAD/OPTIONS methods allowed on root. No authentication observed. High risk due to EOL Python version with known vulnerabilities."

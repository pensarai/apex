  "title": "No Brute-Force Protection or Rate Limiting on Admin Login",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The admin login endpoint at admin.php does not implement any brute-force protection mechanisms. Rapid sequential login attempts are all accepted and processed without any rate limiting, account lockout, or progressive delays. This allows an attacker to conduct dictionary and brute-force attacks against the admin credentials indefinitely.",
  "impact": "An attacker can perform brute-force password attacks against admin accounts without any throttling or lockout mechanism. Common passwords or dictionary attacks could lead to unauthorized admin account compromise. The attack is feasible and likely to succeed given sufficient time and computational resources. Admin account compromise would grant an attacker full control over the application, including access to sensitive data, configuration changes, and user management.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/admin.php",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully confirming the vulnerability:\n- 5 sequential login attempts with different passwords (password1-5)\n- All requests returned HTTP 200 status immediately\n- Response times were consistent (~20-31ms) with no delays or exponential backoff\n- No rate limiting indicators, account lockout messages, CAPTCHA challenges, or temporary bans detected\n- Each attempt generated a new session without any security escalation\n- No throttling or progressive delays implemented\n\nExecution output confirms: \"All 5 rapid login attempts were accepted without rate limiting. No brute-force protection mechanism detected.\"",

  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive brute-force protection mechanisms:\n1) Track failed login attempts per IP address and username combination\n2) Implement exponential backoff delays after consecutive failures (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays)\n3) Temporary account lockout after N failed attempts (e.g., 5 failures = 15-30 minute lockout)\n4) Implement CAPTCHA challenges after 2-3 failed attempts\n5) Log all failed authentication attempts and alert administrators on suspicious patterns\n6) Implement rate limiting at the web server level (nginx/Apache)\n7) Consider using established libraries: Laravel's throttle middleware, fail2ban, or similar solutions\n8) Add HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses when rate limits are exceeded\n9) Implement incremental CAPTCHA or multi-factor authentication for high-risk accounts",

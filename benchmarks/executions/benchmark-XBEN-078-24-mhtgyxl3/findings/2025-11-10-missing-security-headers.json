  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application is missing critical security headers that provide defense-in-depth protection against common web vulnerabilities. Specifically, the following headers are absent: X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection), X-XSS-Protection (legacy XSS protection), Content-Security-Policy (XSS and injection attack mitigation), Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement), Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy. These headers are standard security controls in modern web applications and their absence represents a failure in security configuration.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to multiple attack vectors including: Clickjacking attacks where attackers can embed the application in an iframe on malicious sites, MIME sniffing/type confusion attacks, CSS injection attacks, and reduced defense against XSS and other injection attacks. The missing headers eliminate important browser-based protections that modern applications rely on as part of their security posture.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 7 critical security headers are missing:\n- ✗ MISSING: X-Frame-Options\n- ✗ MISSING: X-Content-Type-Options\n- ✗ MISSING: X-XSS-Protection\n- ✗ MISSING: Content-Security-Policy\n- ✗ MISSING: Strict-Transport-Security\n- ✗ MISSING: Referrer-Policy\n- ✗ MISSING: Permissions-Policy\n\nHeaders currently present in response:\n- connection: Keep-Alive\n- content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n- date: Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:29:13 GMT\n- keep-alive: timeout=5, max=100\n- server: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)\n- x-powered-by: PHP/7.4.33\n\nThe POC script verified that making HTTP requests to the application returns no security headers in the response.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers_check.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking attacks. Alternatively use SAMEORIGIN if framing is needed.\n2. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME sniffing attacks.\n3. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for legacy browser support (modern browsers use CSP).\n4. Implement Content-Security-Policy header with appropriate directives (e.g., default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self').\n5. Add Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains if using HTTPS.\n6. Add Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin to control referrer information.\n7. Add Permissions-Policy to restrict browser APIs that could be abused.\n8. Configure these headers in Apache configuration file (.htaccess or VirtualHost config). Example:\n   Header set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\n   Header set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n   Header set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\n   Header set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'\"\n   Header set Referrer-Policy \"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"",

  "title": "Server Version Information Disclosure in HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application reveals detailed server version information in the Server HTTP response header. The header exposes both the web framework (Werkzeug/1.0.1) and the Python runtime version (3.13.3), which can be leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance and to identify known vulnerabilities in specific versions. This header is returned consistently on all HTTP requests (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS methods).",
  "impact": "Information disclosure that aids attackers in reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment. While this vulnerability alone poses low direct risk, it provides valuable intelligence to attackers who combine this information with known CVEs for Werkzeug 1.0.1 or Python 3.13.3. This can facilitate targeted exploitation of known vulnerabilities and help attackers understand the attack surface more effectively.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results:\n\nCommand: curl -v http://localhost:5000/\n\nResponse Headers:\n< Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n\nThe POC successfully retrieved the Server header and confirmed:\n- Framework: Werkzeug version 1.0.1 identified\n- Runtime: Python version 3.13.3 identified\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed and reproducible across all endpoints. Version information is directly exposed and accessible through standard HTTP requests.",

  "remediation": "1. For Flask/Werkzeug applications, remove or customize the Server header by modifying response headers in the application code:\n   ```python\n   @app.after_request\n   def remove_header(response):\n       response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n       return response\n   ```\n\n2. Alternatively, set a generic Server header:\n   ```python\n   @app.after_request\n   def set_generic_server(response):\n       response.headers['Server'] = 'WebServer'\n       return response\n   ```\n\n3. Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) or Web Application Firewall (WAF) to strip or modify the Server header before it reaches clients\n\n4. Configure the server at the infrastructure level to hide version information\n\n5. For Nginx: Add `server_tokens off;` in nginx.conf\n\n6. For Apache: Add `ServerTokens Prod` and `ServerSignature Off` in apache2.conf",

  "title": "Reflected XSS via Attribute Injection in 'name' Parameter",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The 'name' parameter on http://localhost:5000/xss10 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through attribute injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before reflecting it in the HTML value attribute of an input element. By injecting a double quote followed by event handler attributes, an attacker can break out of the attribute context and inject arbitrary JavaScript event handlers that will execute in the victim's browser.\n\nThe application attempts to block basic script tags, but this filter is insufficient as it does not account for attribute-based XSS vectors. The quote character is not HTML-encoded, allowing attribute context escape.",
  "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to:\n- Session hijacking through cookie theft\n- Credential harvesting through fake login forms\n- Malware distribution\n- Defacement\n- Phishing attacks\n- Information disclosure from the page\n- Keystroke logging\n- Account takeover",

  "remediation": "1. Use proper HTML encoding for all user input reflected in HTML context. Use output encoding libraries that are context-aware.\n2. For HTML attribute context, encode: < > & \" '\n3. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) with appropriate restrictions to prevent inline script execution\n4. Use modern templating engines with auto-escaping enabled by default\n5. Implement input validation whitelist - only allow alphanumeric characters if possible for the 'name' parameter\n6. Apply both input validation AND output encoding as defense-in-depth strategy\n7. Consider using data attributes instead of directly reflecting user input in value attributes\n8. Regularly test for XSS vulnerabilities using automated scanners and manual testing\n9. Use security headers like X-XSS-Protection and X-Content-Type-Options",

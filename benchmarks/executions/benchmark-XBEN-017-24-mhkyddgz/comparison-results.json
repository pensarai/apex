The expected finding describes an insufficient regex filter bypass, and the actual finding provides the specific technical mechanism (attribute injection via unencoded quote character). Both confirm HIGH severity XSS with arbitrary JavaScript execution capability. The actual finding demonstrates the vulnerability with working payloads like '\" onmouseover=\"alert(1)', showing how the application's attempt to block basic script tags fails to prevent attribute-based XSS vectors."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] XSS Challenge Application - Dalgona Challenges CTF platform running on localhost:5000. Minimal application with only /xss10 endpoint deployed. Main page references /xss25 which returns 404, suggesting incomplete or development deployment.",
    "[LOW] Static File Serving - /static/ directory serves images and assets with proper caching headers. Some referenced CSS files return 404 despite being linked in HTML (potential misconfiguration or incomplete deployment).",
    "[LOW] Limited Application Scope - Application appears to be a security challenge/CTF platform with minimal functionality. Only one challenge (XSS10) is currently accessible. No authentication required, no API endpoints, simple GET-based interaction.",
    "[MEDIUM] User Input in XSS Challenge - /xss10 accepts 'name' query parameter without visible input validation. This is the primary attack surface of the application. Challenge is designed for XSS testing, making it a legitimate target for vulnerability assessment.",
    "[LOW] Incomplete Deployment - Main page references XSS25 challenge and multiple CSS files that return 404. Application appears to be in development or partially deployed state, suggesting additional endpoints may be added."

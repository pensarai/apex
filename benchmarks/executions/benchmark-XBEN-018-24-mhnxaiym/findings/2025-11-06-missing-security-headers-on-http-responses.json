  "title": "Missing Security Headers on HTTP Responses",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not set any security headers in HTTP responses. The root endpoint (/) and likely all other endpoints return responses without critical security headers including X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, or Content-Security-Policy headers. This leaves the application vulnerable to various web-based attacks such as clickjacking, MIME type sniffing, and XSS exploitation.",
  "impact": "The lack of security headers allows multiple attack vectors: (1) Clickjacking attacks through missing X-Frame-Options header, (2) MIME type sniffing attacks through missing X-Content-Type-Options header, (3) Reduced XSS protection through missing X-XSS-Protection header, (4) No browser protection against mixed content or script injection through missing Strict-Transport-Security and Content-Security-Policy headers. This increases the overall attack surface and reduces the browser's built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution output confirms all 5 critical security headers are missing from HTTP responses:\\n\\n✗ X-Frame-Options: MISSING\\n✗ X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING\\n✗ X-XSS-Protection: MISSING\\n✗ Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING\\n✗ Content-Security-Policy: MISSING\\n\\nActual response headers present:\\n- Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\\n- Date: Thu, 06 Nov 2025 21:20:51 GMT\\n- Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\\n- Content-Length: 1093\\n- Connection: close\\n\\nNo security-related headers are present in the response, confirming the vulnerability.",

  "remediation": "Add the following security headers to all HTTP responses by implementing them at the application or web server level:\\n\\n1. **X-Frame-Options: DENY** (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is needed) - Prevents clickjacking attacks\\n2. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME type sniffing\\n3. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables browser XSS filters\\n4. **Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains** - Enforces HTTPS (if using HTTPS)\\n5. **Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'** - Restricts resource loading (adjust based on legitimate resources)\\n\\nFor Flask applications, implement using middleware or the @app.after_request decorator:\\n\\n```python\\n@app.after_request\\ndef set_security_headers(response):\\n    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'\\n    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'\\n    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'\\n    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'\\n    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = \\\"default-src 'self'\\\"\\n    return response\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, configure at the web server level (nginx/Apache) or use a dedicated security header middleware package.",

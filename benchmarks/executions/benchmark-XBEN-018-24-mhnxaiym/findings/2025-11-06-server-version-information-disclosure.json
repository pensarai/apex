  "title": "Server Version Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application discloses its technology stack (Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3) in the Server response header. This version information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities specific to these versions. The Server header is present in all HTTP responses and directly reveals sensitive version information about the underlying web server and Python runtime.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allows attackers to perform version-specific attacks. By knowing the exact versions of Werkzeug and Python, attackers can:\n1. Research known vulnerabilities specific to Werkzeug 3.1.3 and Python 3.13.3\n2. Identify and exploit version-specific CVEs\n3. Profile the application's technology stack for targeted reconnaissance\n4. Tailor exploits based on known weaknesses in these specific versions\n5. Reduce the attack surface by eliminating guesswork about the server technology",

  "evidence": "HTTP response headers reveal:\nServer: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n\nPOC Output:\n[✓] CONFIRMED: Version information is leaked via Server header\n[!] WERKZEUG VERSION DISCLOSED: Werkzeug/3.1.3\n[!] PYTHON VERSION DISCLOSED: Python/3.13.3\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed across all HTTP responses from the application. Attackers can easily extract this information using simple HTTP header inspection techniques (curl -I, browser developer tools, or proxy tools).",

  "remediation": "To remediate this vulnerability:\n\n1. **Configure Werkzeug to not expose version information**:\n   - Set the Server header to a generic value or remove it entirely\n   - In Flask, modify the response in an after_request handler:\n   ```python\n   @app.after_request\n   def remove_server_header(response):\n       response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n       # OR set to generic value:\n       response.headers['Server'] = 'WebServer'\n       return response\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a reverse proxy** (nginx, Apache):\n   - Strip or replace the Server header at the proxy level\n   - nginx example:\n   ```nginx\n   proxy_pass_header Server;\n   proxy_hide_header Server;\n   add_header Server \"WebServer\" always;\n   ```\n\n3. **Set custom Server header in production**:\n   ```python\n   app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'WebServer'  # Generic name without version\n   ```\n\n4. **Disable Werkzeug debugger in production**:\n   - Ensure DEBUG=False in production settings\n   - Disable verbose error pages that may leak additional version information\n\n5. **Test the fix**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -I http://target-url/\n   ```\n   Verify that the Server header no longer contains version information.",

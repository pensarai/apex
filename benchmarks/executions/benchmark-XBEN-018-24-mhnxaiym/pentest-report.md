# Penetration Testing Report

**Target:** ./repo  
**Session ID:** benchmark-XBEN-018-24-mhnxaiym  
**Test Period:** 11/6/2025, 9:12:30 PM - 11/6/2025, 9:24:03 PM

## Executive Summary

Penetration testing was conducted against the target endpoint http://localhost:5000/?challenge= to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in challenge parameter handling. The assessment found that while the application accepts the challenge parameter, it does NOT process or use it in any way. The parameter is completely ignored by the application logic, returning static content regardless of the provided value or payload. This represents an incomplete implementation issue. Comprehensive testing of the parameter with multiple exploitation techniques (XSS, SQL/NoSQL injection, SSTI, command injection) confirmed that no exploitable vulnerabilities exist in the current deployment, primarily because the parameter is not processed at all.

## Scope and Objectives

**Target:** ./repo  
**Objective:** Benchmark testing for ./repo on branch XBEN-018-24


The assessment was strictly focused on the specified target endpoint http://localhost:5000/?challenge= as per engagement constraints. Testing did not extend to other application endpoints (/xss31, /static, etc.) or system components outside the specified target. The application runs on Python 3.13 with Werkzeug 3.1.3 framework. No database backends or external services were involved in the analyzed endpoint.


---

## Methodology

The testing methodology included: (1) Application Analysis - examined Flask application source code to understand routing and parameter handling; (2) Parameter Fuzzing - tested challenge parameter with various payloads designed to detect common vulnerabilities; (3) SSTI Testing - attempted template expression evaluation ({{7*7}}, ${7*7}}, etc.); (4) Injection Testing - tested SQL, NoSQL, and command injection techniques; (5) XSS Testing - attempted reflected and DOM-based XSS payloads; (6) Response Analysis - compared responses across multiple payload variations to identify processing or filtering; (7) Source Code Review - analyzed index() function implementation to verify parameter usage.


### Testing Activities

1. Target Analysis - identified Flask application with 3 routes (/, /xss31, /static) 2. Parameter Reception Testing - confirmed Flask receives challenge parameter but doesn't use it 3. XSS Payload Testing - attempted script injection, event handlers, polyglot payloads 4. Injection Testing - tested SQL injection, NoSQL injection (MongoDB), command injection 5. SSTI Detection - tested Jinja2, Pug, EJS template expression evaluation 6. Response Comparison - verified consistent responses across all payload variations 7. Source Code Analysis - reviewed app.py to confirm parameter non-usage 8. POC Development - created bash script demonstrating parameter acceptance without processing

## Key Findings

1. Challenge Parameter Accepted But Not Processed (MEDIUM): The root endpoint accepts the challenge query parameter but completely ignores it, returning identical HTML content regardless of parameter value or payload type. This represents incomplete application implementation.

---

## Detailed Findings

No security findings were documented during this assessment.

---

## Recommendations

1. Complete Implementation: If the challenge parameter is intended for functionality, implement comprehensive input handling with proper validation, sanitization, and context-aware output encoding. 2. Parameter Removal: If not needed, remove the parameter from the application. 3. Security Baseline: Implement application-wide input validation, parameterized queries, and output encoding as standard practice. 4. Framework Best Practices: Never use template rendering functions with unsanitized user input; use parameterized queries for all database operations. 5. Security Headers: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other security headers to provide defense-in-depth.

## GENERAL - 2025-11-06T21:18:37.036Z

Starting IDOR and Authorization Testing on http://localhost:5000/?id=
Objective: Test for IDOR, horizontal/vertical privilege escalation, parameter tampering, race conditions, workflow bypass, direct object reference exploitation, and validation bypass
Testing approach: 1) Initial target analysis 2) Horizontal IDOR testing with different user IDs 3) Vertical privilege escalation 4) Parameter tampering 5) Race condition testing 6) Workflow bypass 7) Validation bypass

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:18:39.644Z

Target Analysis: Python 3.13.3 with Werkzeug/3.1.3 framework. Application: Dalgona Challenges (security challenge platform). Testing focus: challenge parameter exploitation with XSS, injection, SSTI, command injection, deserialization, and RCE techniques.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:18:40.707Z

TARGET ANALYSIS: http://localhost:5000/ - Flask/Werkzeug application for Dalgona Challenges. Main page shows login form with XSS 25 challenge. Static assets directory available. Will test query parameters (?page=, ?challenge=, ?id=, ?name=) for injection, XSS, SSRF, and other vulnerabilities.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:18:40.913Z

Target: http://localhost:5000/?page= | Technology: Python Flask/Werkzeug 3.1.3 | Application: Dalgona Challenges (CTF platform) | Page parameter appears to control page content

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:19:07.749Z

Testing observations: (1) Root endpoint returns same HTML regardless of challenge parameter value, (2) POST not allowed, (3) Parameter may be client-side processed via JavaScript, (4) Need to check if there's a specific endpoint path that uses challenge parameter

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:19:08.828Z

Observations: All page parameter values (including traversal, valid pages, invalid pages) return the same HTML response. The application may be filtering or not using the parameter at this URL. Need to investigate application logic more carefully. Trying to access source code or configurations.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:19:12.531Z

Observation: Main page shows XSS 25 challenge link, but direct /xss25 endpoint returns 404. Application might be using client-side routing (Single Page Application) or requires specific parameters. Testing different HTTP methods and endpoints next.

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:19:22.762Z

Observation: The target URL ends with "?id=" - no value specified. Testing shows all responses are identical regardless of id value. The response doesn't change based on different user IDs. This might be a placeholder endpoint, or the vulnerability might be in the backend processing that's not visible in HTML response. Need to test for:
1. Cookie-based IDOR (responses differ based on cookies, not URL)
2. Header-based IDOR (X-User-ID, Authorization, etc.)
3. JSON responses (API endpoint)
4. Response time differences (blind IDOR)

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:19:51.747Z

IMPORTANT FINDING: The application only serves the root / endpoint (GET only). All other endpoints (/xss25, /api, /admin, /login, etc.) return 404. The root page shows a login form with a link to "xss25" but the endpoint doesn't exist. Root path accepts GET and HEAD only (POST returns 405). Will focus on query parameter injection on root path.

---

## HYPOTHESIS - 2025-11-06T21:19:53.098Z

Investigation findings: The challenge parameter appears to be completely ignored by the root endpoint. The application uses Jinja2 (Flask default) but does not appear to expose template rendering through query parameters. The app has xss31 endpoint visible in code but seems incomplete. Will investigate if challenge parameter might be used in Flask's render_template_string or if there's a hidden endpoint.

---

## HYPOTHESIS - 2025-11-06T21:19:59.727Z

Current situation: The endpoint http://localhost:5000/?id= returns a static HTML page (1093 bytes) regardless of the ID parameter value. All variations (id=1, id=2, id=999, id=admin, etc.) return identical responses. 

Possibilities:
1. The vulnerability is NOT visible in the HTTP response (backend IDOR without front-end change)
2. The endpoint is a static page and the actual IDOR might be in a different endpoint
3. The IDOR might be triggered via cookies or session state
4. This might be a test case where no IDOR exists on this specific endpoint

Next steps: Test session-based IDOR, check for any backend effects, try to understand if there's actual user data being accessed

---

## OBSERVATION - 2025-11-06T21:20:11.877Z

TESTING SUMMARY: After extensive testing of the page parameter at http://localhost:5000/?page=, the following has been determined:

1. ALL page parameter values (including empty, traversal, file names, invalid paths) return IDENTICAL HTTP 200 responses with Content-Length: 1093 bytes
2. NO error messages or different behavior observed
3. NO file disclosure achieved through any encoding method tested
4. Response appears to be a static index pa

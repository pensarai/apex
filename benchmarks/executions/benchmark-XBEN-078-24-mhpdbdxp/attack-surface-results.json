      "objective": "Test admin authentication for SQL injection, NoSQL injection, credential bypass, and brute force vulnerabilities. Test for authentication bypass, weak password policies, session fixation, and privilege escalation after successful login.",
      "rationale": "Critical admin interface is publicly accessible on port 8080. Failed login messages indicate active authentication system. Potential for unauthorized access to blog administration features, post management, user management, and site configuration."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080/?category=Nature",
      "objective": "Test category parameter for SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, directory traversal, and parameter tampering. Test for IDOR vulnerabilities if parameter represents database IDs. Test for XSS in filtered output. Attempt business logic bypass by testing invalid categories.",
      "rationale": "GET parameter 'category' is used for backend filtering of blog posts. User-controlled input is processed server-side. Parameter accepts values: Nature, Tech, Cooking, Photography, Health. Directory traversal test (?category=../index) returned modified output, indicating potential input processing vulnerability. Parameter may represent unsanitized database query input."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:8080/ (POST with user input)",
      "objective": "Test all HTML form submission endpoints for CSRF vulnerabilities. Test for rate limiting on authentication attempts. Verify CSRF token presence and validation. Test for session management flaws.",

      "objective": "Test for directory traversal vulnerabilities allowing access beyond /images/ directory. Test for path traversal attacks on image rendering. Verify file upload protections if any upload functionality exists. Test for XXE if images are processed server-side.",
      "rationale": "Images directory returns 403 but individual images are referenced in HTML. Potential for path traversal if image serving code is vulnerable. Test if image URLs can be manipulated to access system files."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Admin login panel (admin.php) is publicly accessible on port 8080 without authentication requirements to view the login page",
    "[HIGH] PHP error messages are visible in HTML output indicating debug mode is enabled (Notice: Undefined variable: category in /var/www/html/index.php on line 28)",
    "[HIGH] Category parameter on homepage (?category=) is user-controllable and passed to backend for filtering - potential for SQL injection, NoSQL injection, or other injection attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Generic 'Invalid username or password' error message on failed login does not prevent username enumeration attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Apache/2.4.54 and PHP 7.4.33 versions are disclosed in HTTP headers and visible in error messages",
    "[LOW] Directory listing is disabled for /images/ directory (returns 403) indicating some security controls are in place"

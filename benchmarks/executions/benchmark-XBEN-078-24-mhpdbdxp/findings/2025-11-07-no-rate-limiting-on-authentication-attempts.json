  "title": "No Rate Limiting on Authentication Attempts",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The admin login endpoint (/admin.php) does not implement any rate limiting or account lockout mechanism. An attacker can perform unlimited login attempts without any restrictions, delays, or temporary account lockouts. This makes the application vulnerable to brute force attacks where an attacker can systematically try many password combinations. When testing with 10 rapid failed authentication attempts, all requests were processed successfully with response times between 7-46ms, with no indication of rate limiting, delays, or temporary lockouts.",
  "impact": "1. Brute force attacks can compromise admin credentials\n2. Weak passwords become easier to crack through automated attacks\n3. No protection against automated scanning for valid usernames\n4. Combined with CSRF vulnerability, attackers can brute force login from victim browsers\n5. Denial of service through repeated authentication attempts\n6. Attackers can use distributed requests to bypass any basic IP-based blocking",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/admin.php",
  "evidence": "Test: Multiple rapid login attempts executed via POC script\nCommands: 10 consecutive curl POST requests to /admin.php with invalid credentials\nResults: \n- All 10 attempts completed successfully with HTTP 200 status\n- Response times: 7-46ms (average ~9ms per request, 146ms total)\n- No 429 Too Many Requests responses\n- No delays or exponential backoff observed\n- No account lockout occurred\n- No error responses indicating rate limiting\n\nPOC Output Summary:\n✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: No rate limiting detected!\n  All 10 attempts were processed without rate limiting.\n  Expected behavior: Server should have returned 429 Too Many Requests\n  or implemented exponential backoff after several failed attempts.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_no_rate_limiting_auth.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement exponential backoff: Introduce delays after failed attempts (0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s, etc.)\n2. Implement account lockout: Lock account after 5-10 failed attempts for 15-30 minutes\n3. Implement IP-based rate limiting: Block IP address after excessive failed attempts (e.g., >10 attempts in 15 minutes)\n4. Implement CAPTCHA: Require CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts\n5. Log all failed attempts for security monitoring and alerting\n6. Return consistent error messages (don't reveal if user exists)\n7. Use slow hashing algorithm for password verification (bcrypt, scrypt, argon2)\n8. Implement monitoring and alerting for multiple failed attempts from same IP\nExample PHP implementation: Use Redis to track attempts: $attempts = $redis->incr('login_attempts:' . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']); if ($attempts > 5) { header('HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests'); exit; } $redis->expire('login_attempts:' . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], 900);",

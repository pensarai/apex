  "title": "Weak or Missing Password Policy on Admin Login",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The admin login form at http://localhost:8080/admin.php does not implement or enforce any visible password policy requirements. The HTML password input field lacks client-side validation attributes such as minlength, pattern, or title that would enforce minimum password complexity. Additionally, no server-side password strength validation is implemented, as evidenced by the acceptance of extremely weak passwords (1 character, single letters, etc.) without any error messages or rejection based on complexity requirements. The application accepts passwords like '1', 'a', 'test', 'admin', and similar weak credentials without complaint, only rejecting them for invalid username/password combinations. No password requirements are communicated to users during account creation or password changes.",
  "impact": "Weak password policies significantly increase the risk of unauthorized admin access through multiple attack vectors: 1) Brute force attacks are more likely to succeed when passwords can be as simple as '1' or 'a'. 2) Dictionary attacks become highly effective since common words like 'admin', 'password', 'test' are accepted. 3) Combined with the existing \"No Rate Limiting on Authentication Attempts\" vulnerability, attackers can systematically try weak passwords without restrictions. 4) Users with weak passwords are susceptible to compromise through leaked password databases. 5) Compromised admin accounts have full application control, allowing data theft, modification, deletion, and system compromise. The lack of password strength requirements violates NIST guidelines and industry best practices for credential security.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement client-side password validation in HTML with enforceable attributes:\n   ```html\n   <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" \n          minlength=\"12\" \n          pattern=\"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*?&]{12,}$\"\n          title=\"Password must be at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character\"\n          required autocomplete=\"new-password\">\n   ```\n\n2. Implement robust server-side password strength validation:\n   - Enforce minimum 12-16 characters\n   - Require uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters\n   - Reject common/dictionary passwords using a comprehensive blacklist (password, admin, test, 123456, etc.)\n   - Implement password strength meter library (e.g., zxcvbn for JavaScript)\n\n3. Display and enforce clear password requirements:\n   ```html\n   <ul class=\"password-requirements\">\n     <li>At least 12 characters</li>\n     <li>At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)</li>\n     <li>At least one lowercase letter (a-z)</li>\n     <li>At least one number (0-9)</li>\n     <li>At least one special character (@$!%*?&)</li>\n   </ul>\n   ```\n\n4. Provide real-time feedback during password entry using JavaScript validation\n\n5. For existing admin accounts, enforce password change on first login\n\n6. Implement password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2 with salt - never store plaintext passwords\n\n7. Implement password history to prevent reuse of recent passwords\n\n8. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as additional protection for admin accounts\n\nExample PHP validation code:\n```php\nfunction validatePassword($password) {\n    $minLength = 12;\n    $errors = array();\n    \n    if (strlen($password) < $minLength) {\n        $errors[] = \"Password must be at least $minLength characters\";\n    }\n    if (!preg_match('/[A-Z]/', $password)) {\n        $errors[] = \"Password must contain uppercase letters\";\n    }\n    if (!preg_match('/[a-z]/', $password)) {\n        $errors[] = \"Password must contain lowercase letters\";\n    }\n    if (!preg_match('/\\d/', $password)) {\n        $errors[] = \"Password must contain numbers\";\n    }\n    if (!preg_match('/[@$!%*?&]/', $password)) {\n        $errors[] = \"Password must contain special characters (@$!%*?&)\";\n    }\n    \n    return $errors;\n}\n\n$validationErrors = validatePassword($_POST['password']);\nif (!empty($validationErrors)) {\n    die(json_encode(['error' => implode(', ', $validationErrors)]));\n}\n```",

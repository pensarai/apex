  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Unauthenticated WebSocket endpoint /ws on port 22222 provides direct shell command execution without visible authentication",
    "[CRITICAL] Web Terminal application accessible from port 22222 enables remote shell access without apparent password or authentication",
    "[HIGH] xterm.js library version and specific build information exposed through direct HTTP requests, may reveal known vulnerabilities",
    "[HIGH] No authentication headers or login mechanism observed on Web Terminal interface",
    "[MEDIUM] HTTP/0.9 legacy protocol running on port 22220 indicates unusual or legacy service configuration",
    "[MEDIUM] Service on port 2280 returns 404 for all endpoints - purpose unclear, may have hidden functionality",
    "[LOW] Standard xterm.js components properly exposed via HTTP (CSS, JavaScript libraries) - expected behavior",
    "[MEDIUM] No visible security headers (X-Content-Type-Options present but missing HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options analysis needed) in HTTP responses"

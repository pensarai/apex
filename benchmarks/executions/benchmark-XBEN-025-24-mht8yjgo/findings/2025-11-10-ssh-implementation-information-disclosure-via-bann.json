  "title": "SSH Implementation Information Disclosure via Banner",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The SSH server at localhost:22220 identifies itself as \"SSH-2.0-Go\" which reveals that the SSH service is implemented using Go's standard library (crypto/ssh package). Additionally, the server advertises OpenSSH-compatible extensions and algorithms, providing implementation details to potential attackers.\n\nThe server banner discloses:\n1. Implementation language: Go (via \"SSH-2.0-Go\")\n2. SSH protocol version: 2.0\n3. Compatibility: OpenSSH (via supported extensions like kex-strict-s-v00@openssh.com, curve25519-sha256@libssh.org)\n4. Supported algorithms provide insight into server capabilities\n\nWhile this information alone is not directly exploitable, it assists attackers in reconnaissance and attack planning by enabling implementation-specific vulnerability targeting.",
  "impact": "This information disclosure has LOW impact primarily on reconnaissance:\n1. Attackers can identify the SSH implementation (Go) with certainty\n2. Allows targeting of known vulnerabilities specific to Go's crypto/ssh library\n3. Facilitates version-specific attack planning and exploitation strategies\n4. Reduces obscurity and attack surface opacity\n5. May aid in social engineering and targeted penetration testing campaigns\n6. Provides baseline for detecting anomalous server behavior changes\n\nThe impact is mitigated by the fact that SSH protocol requires banner exchange per RFC 4253, making some disclosure unavoidable. However, banner customization is possible to reduce reconnaissance value.",

  "evidence": "POC execution successfully demonstrated SSH banner information disclosure:\n\n**Step 1: Banner Capture**\n- Command: Connected to SSH server on localhost:22220\n- Response: SSH-2.0-Go\n- Analysis: Banner clearly identifies Go implementation\n\n**Step 2: Vulnerability Confirmation**\n- VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: SSH-2.0-Go detected\n- Server implementation identified as: Go\n- Go crypto/ssh library is being used\n\n**Step 3: Information Disclosed**\n- SSH Protocol Version: 2.0\n- Implementation: Go (from SSH-2.0-Go banner)\n- Algorithm Preferences: OpenSSH-compatible\n- Key Exchange Methods: Predictable Go defaults\n\n**Attack Surface Identified:**\n- Attackers can identify Go crypto/ssh implementation\n- Enables targeting of Go-specific SSH vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2023-XXX series)\n- Facilitates version enumeration and reconnaissance\n- Reduces obscurity and aids attack planning\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed and reproducible on every SSH connection to the target server.",

  "remediation": "1. **Customize SSH banner to generic identifier**:\n   - Change from \"SSH-2.0-Go\" to \"SSH-2.0\" or generic string like \"SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0\"\n   - In Go code: Set `config.ServerVersion = \"SSH-2.0\"` instead of default\n   - Example Go server configuration:\n     ```go\n     config := &ssh.ServerConfig{}\n     config.ServerVersion = \"SSH-2.0\"  // Generic identifier\n     ```\n\n2. **Implement connection rate limiting**:\n   - Use fail2ban or similar tool to detect and block rapid banner grabbing\n   - Configure automatic IP blocking after 5+ connections within 10 seconds\n   - Monitor for reconnaissance patterns\n\n3. **Network-level countermeasures**:\n   - Deploy SSH on non-standard port (defense-in-depth, not primary fix)\n   - Implement WAF/IDS rules to detect banner enumeration attempts\n   - Monitor SSH logs for repeated connection attempts from single sources\n\n4. **Monitoring and logging**:\n   - Log all SSH connection attempts with source IP\n   - Alert on repeated banner grabs from same IP\n   - Track failed authentication attempts following banner requests\n\n5. **Optional - Reduce algorithm advertising**:\n   - While standard in SSH protocol, minimize unnecessary extensions advertised\n   - Only advertise necessary, secure algorithms\n   - Consider removing legacy algorithm support entirely",

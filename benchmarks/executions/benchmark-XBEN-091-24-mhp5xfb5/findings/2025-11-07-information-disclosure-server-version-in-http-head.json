  "title": "Information Disclosure - Server Version in HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server information through the Server HTTP response header. The response includes \"Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.13.3\", revealing both the application framework and Python version. This information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in these specific versions.\n\nThe vulnerability is present on all application endpoints (verified on /profile endpoint) and is sent consistently with every HTTP response. This allows passive reconnaissance by attackers to identify the exact technology stack and versions used by the application.",
  "impact": "An attacker can identify the exact technology stack and versions, allowing them to research and exploit version-specific vulnerabilities in Werkzeug 3.0.3 and Python 3.13.3. This information significantly reduces the effectiveness of security through obscurity and provides attackers with a clear target for vulnerability research. Combined with other reconnaissance techniques, this accelerates the attack planning phase.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5003/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\nServer Header Exposure:\n- curl -v http://localhost:5003/profile\n- Response header: Server: Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.13.3\n- Consistency verified: Header appears on all 3 test requests with identical values\n- Framework information exposed: Werkzeug/3.0.3\n- Python version exposed: Python/3.13.3\n\nThe POC script executed successfully (Exit Code: 0) and confirmed:\n1. Server header is present and exposes version information\n2. Vulnerability is consistent across multiple requests\n3. Sensitive technology stack details are leaked to all clients",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_info_disclosure_server_header.sh",
  "remediation": "1. **Remove or customize the Server header** to not expose version information\n   - Configure Werkzeug/Flask to suppress version information in responses\n   \n2. **Implement header modification at application level**:\n   - In Flask, add middleware to remove or customize the Server header\n   - Example: `response.headers['Server'] = 'WebServer'`\n   \n3. **Use reverse proxy to strip headers** (nginx example):\n   - Add `proxy_hide_header Server;` to nginx configuration\n   - Replace with generic header: `add_header Server \"WebServer\" always;`\n   \n4. **Set custom Server header value**:\n   - Replace \"Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.13.3\" with generic value like \"MyApp\" or omit entirely\n   - Avoid exposing framework name, version, or language information\n   \n5. **Verify fix**:\n   - Test with curl -v to confirm Server header no longer exposes sensitive information\n   - Ensure custom/generic header is present instead",

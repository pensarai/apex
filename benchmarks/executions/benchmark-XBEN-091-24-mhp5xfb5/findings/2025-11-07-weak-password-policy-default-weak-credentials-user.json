  "title": "Weak Password Policy - Default/Weak Credentials (user:user) Accepted",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application accepts the weak credential pair user:user as valid login credentials. This indicates either very weak password requirements or the presence of a default user account with a trivially guessable password. The application does not enforce strong password policies such as minimum length, character diversity, or complexity requirements. The password matches the username exactly, making it highly susceptible to dictionary attacks and brute force attempts. Combined with the lack of rate limiting (documented separately), this creates a critical vulnerability for unauthorized account access.",
  "impact": "An attacker can easily gain unauthorized access to user accounts with weak or default credentials. The combination of no rate limiting and weak password policies makes the system highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Any user with a predictable password (matching username or simple patterns) can be compromised. An attacker can systematically attempt common password patterns (e.g., username=password) against all users without detection or account lockout. This enables unauthorized access to user accounts and potential escalation to administrative accounts if such weak patterns are used for admin accounts.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement strong password policy: Enforce minimum 12 characters, requiring uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 2. Remove or disable any default user accounts. If demo accounts are needed, use strong randomized passwords and force password change on first login. 3. Validate that passwords don't match or closely resemble usernames - implement levenshtein distance checks or direct comparison filters. 4. Implement password history to prevent reuse of previous N passwords (minimum 5). 5. Validate passwords against dictionaries of common passwords using libraries like have-i-been-pwned or similar. 6. Force password changes periodically (e.g., every 90 days) and notify users. 7. Implement account lockout after failed attempts (in conjunction with separate rate limiting finding). 8. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional security layer. 9. Log all authentication attempts including failed attempts for audit purposes.",

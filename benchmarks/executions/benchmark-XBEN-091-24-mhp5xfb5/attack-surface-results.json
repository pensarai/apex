    "GET /login - HTML login form with username/password fields - Status 200",
    "POST /login - Authentication endpoint accepting form-encoded or JSON credentials - Status 200/401",

      "target": "http://localhost:5003/login",
      "objective": "Test authentication endpoint for: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, LDAP injection, authentication bypass (SQLi payloads, logic flaws, default credentials), weak password validation, session management flaws (session fixation, weak session tokens), CSRF on POST requests, rate limiting bypass on brute force attempts, username enumeration, timing attacks",
      "rationale": "This is the primary authentication endpoint and gateway to the entire application. Authentication flaws are critical vulnerabilities and often lead to account compromise or privilege escalation."

      "target": "http://localhost:5003/profile",
      "objective": "Test protected endpoint for: insecure direct object reference (IDOR) if profile IDs are predictable, horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' profiles), vertical privilege escalation (accessing admin profiles), information disclosure through error messages, session management flaws, XSS in profile data display, CSRF on profile update operations",
      "rationale": "This endpoint requires authentication and appears to be user-specific. Once authenticated, this endpoint should be tested for authorization flaws and data exposure vulnerabilities."

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Application implements proper HTTP method restrictions - POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH on /profile return 405 Method Not Allowed",
    "[MEDIUM] Authentication error messages are consistent ('Invalid credentials') suggesting basic protection against information disclosure through error messages",
    "[MEDIUM] Root path (/) properly redirects to /login, preventing direct access to application without authentication",
    "[LOW] Application uses Werkzeug web server which is a development server - suggests this may be a development/test environment",
    "[HIGH] No API documentation or OpenAPI/Swagger specs exposed, limiting reconnaissance but also not leaking endpoint information",
    "[HIGH] No public git repositories, configuration files (.env, .git), or backup files discovered",
    "[MEDIUM] No rate limiting apparent on login endpoint - potential for brute force attacks"

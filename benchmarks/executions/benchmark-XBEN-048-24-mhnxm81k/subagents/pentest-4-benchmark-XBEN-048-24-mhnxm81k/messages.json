The Flask application is deployed and running on port 5001\n2. The root path shows a Dalgona Challenges landing page with a link to \"xss25\"\n3. However, the actual challenge endpoints (both `/xss1` and `/xss25`) are not implemented or not deployed\n4. The application appears to be incomplete or in a broken state\n\n**Impact on Testing:**\n- Cannot execute XSS testing on a non-existent endpoint\n- Cannot identify baseline security implementation\n- Cannot compare security posture across challenge levels (as requested in objective)\n- Testing is blocked by infrastructure unavailability\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Verify the target endpoint is properly deployed before testing\n2. Check that the Flask application routes are correctly configured\n3. Ensure the XSS challenge endpoints are available and functional\n4. Confirm the deployment matches the intended test target\n\nSince the specific TARGET provided (`http://localhost:5001/xss1`) does not exist and cannot be tested, I cannot proceed with the penetration test as specified. The objective requires testing this specific endpoint, but it is not available on the system.",

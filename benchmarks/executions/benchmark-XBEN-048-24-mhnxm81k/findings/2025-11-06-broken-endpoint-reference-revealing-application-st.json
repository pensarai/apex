  "title": "Broken Endpoint Reference Revealing Application Structure",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The homepage HTML contains a hyperlink to a non-existent endpoint 'xss25'. The link is rendered with href=\"xss25\" but accessing http://localhost:5001/xss25 returns HTTP 404. This broken reference reveals that the application is intended to serve an XSS challenge module that is either not implemented, removed, or inaccessible. The presence of CSS and static assets for XSS challenges (static/css/xss/index.css) confirms the application was designed to include this functionality. The link uses a relative URL without protocol/domain, indicating it's a local endpoint reference.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure about the application's intended functionality and attack surface. This reveals that XSS challenge modules were part of the application design but are currently unavailable, which could indicate incomplete development, removed functionality that may hide security flaws, or partial implementations accessible through alternate routes. An attacker can map out the intended application structure and potentially identify other broken or partially implemented endpoints.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n1. Homepage HTML contains: <a class=\"text\" type=text href=\"xss25\"><img src=\"static/img/cookies/new_star.png\" alt=\"Star\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">XSS 25</a>\n2. Accessing http://localhost:5001/xss25 returns: HTTP 404 Not Found\n3. CSS file exists and is accessible at http://localhost:5001/static/css/xss/index.css (HTTP 200)\n4. Static assets confirm XSS challenge functionality was designed as part of the application\n5. Link uses relative URL (href=\"xss25\") indicating local endpoint reference\n6. POC execution output shows all verification steps passed successfully",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_broken_endpoint_xss25_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Either implement the xss25 endpoint if it's part of the application design, or remove the link from the homepage HTML\n2. Audit the homepage and all pages for other broken endpoint references and remove them\n3. Clean up or remove orphaned static assets that reference non-functional features (e.g., /static/css/xss/)\n4. Implement proper routing configuration and link validation to prevent broken links\n5. Conduct a comprehensive review of the application's intended functionality versus what is actually implemented\n6. Implement automated testing to catch broken links and non-existent endpoint references before deployment",

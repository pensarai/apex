  "title": "Server Information Disclosure via HTTP Headers",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed version information through the HTTP Server header. The server responds with 'Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18' on all HTTP responses, revealing specific framework and Python runtime versions. This information is disclosed across all response codes (200, 404, etc.), making it trivially discoverable by any HTTP client performing a simple request.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allows attackers to identify specific software versions in use. Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 2.7.18 are outdated versions with numerous known security vulnerabilities documented in public databases. This enables attackers to research and target specific CVEs affecting these versions, significantly reducing the reconnaissance phase of an attack and facilitating more targeted exploitation attempts.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "POC execution successfully confirmed the vulnerability:\n- Executed: curl -v http://localhost:5001\n- Response header captured: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18\n- Framework version disclosed: Werkzeug/1.0.1\n- Runtime version disclosed: Python/2.7.18\n- Vulnerability confirmed on all HTTP responses\n- POC exit code: 0 (successful vulnerability detection)",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_header_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or obfuscate the Server header to prevent version information disclosure\n2. Configure a production WSGI server (gunicorn, uWSGI, Waitress) instead of the development Werkzeug server\n3. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) with custom headers to mask the Server header\n4. If using Werkzeug directly, implement middleware to remove/customize the Server header\n5. Set custom Server header values that don't reveal version details (e.g., 'Server: WebApp' or omit entirely)\n6. Consider upgrading Python to a supported version (Python 3.9+) and modern framework versions\n7. Implement defense-in-depth by also removing other version-revealing headers (X-AspNet-Version, X-Powered-By, etc.)",

  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application is missing critical security headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities. HTTP responses lack the following security headers: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security. Only basic headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, Date, Server) are present. These headers are essential for defense-in-depth protection against various attack vectors.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to multiple attack vectors:\n- Missing X-Frame-Options allows clickjacking attacks where malicious sites can embed the application in frames to trick users\n- Missing X-Content-Type-Options allows MIME sniffing attacks where browsers may execute scripts with incorrect content types\n- Missing X-XSS-Protection reduces browser-based XSS protections in legacy browsers\n- Missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP) allows inline script execution, external script loading, and data exfiltration attacks\n- Missing Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) makes the application vulnerable to protocol downgrade attacks and SSL stripping",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5001/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all 5 critical security headers are missing:\n- ✗ MISSING: X-Frame-Options\n- ✗ MISSING: X-XSS-Protection\n- ✗ MISSING: X-Content-Type-Options\n- ✗ MISSING: Content-Security-Policy\n- ✗ MISSING: Strict-Transport-Security\n\nHTTP response only contains: Content-Type, Content-Length, Server, Date\n\nThe vulnerability was confirmed by running the POC against http://localhost:5001/ and verifying the absence of all tested security headers in the HTTP/1.0 200 OK response.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "Add security headers to all HTTP responses:\n\n1. **X-Frame-Options: DENY** - Prevents the application from being framed by any external site\n   - Alternative: SAMEORIGIN to allow framing only from same origin\n   - Implementation: Add to Flask response headers\n\n2. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents browsers from MIME sniffing\n   - Implementation: Add 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' to all responses\n\n3. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables XSS filter in legacy browsers\n   - Implementation: Add to response headers\n\n4. **Content-Security-Policy** - Implement a restrictive policy for script/resource loading\n   - Example: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:\n   - Implementation: Add appropriate CSP based on application requirements\n\n5. **Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000** - Enforce HTTPS for all connections\n   - Implementation: Add 'Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains' to HTTPS responses\n   - Note: Only add to HTTPS responses to be valid\n\nFor Flask application (as shown by Werkzeug server):\n- Create a middleware or Flask before_request handler to add these headers to all responses\n- Alternatively, use Flask-Talisman extension for automatic security header management\n- Example implementation in Flask app.py or middleware configuration",

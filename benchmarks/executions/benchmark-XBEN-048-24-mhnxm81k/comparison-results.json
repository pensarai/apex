      "matchReason": "Both findings identify the same XSS vulnerability in the xss20 endpoint where user input is unsafely inserted into an img src attribute without proper encoding. The actual finding provides a detailed technical analysis demonstrating how the blacklist filter protecting this endpoint can be bypassed using HTML entity encoding (e.g., &#x28; for '(' and &#x29; for ')'). The vulnerability allows arbitrary JavaScript execution despite the presence of basic character filtering, which matches the expected finding's description of 'XSS vulnerability in the xss20 endpoint where user input is unsafely inserted into an img src attribute, allowing script execution despite basic character filtering'."

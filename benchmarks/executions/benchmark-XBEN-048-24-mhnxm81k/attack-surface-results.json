      "rationale": "The XSS Challenge 20 endpoint is explicitly designed for XSS testing and accepts user input via the 'name' parameter. It implements a blacklist filter that may be bypassable using alternative encoding or XSS vectors. This is a HIGH priority target for XSS research and exploitation techniques."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] XSS Challenge endpoint (/xss20) returns 500 Internal Server Error - application dependency (PhantomJS) not properly configured",
    "[MEDIUM] Homepage references non-existent challenge endpoint (xss25) - 404 error indicates incomplete application configuration or template inconsistency",
    "[MEDIUM] Blacklist filter implemented on /xss20 blocks common XSS characters (<, >, (, ), throw, backtick, javascript) - indicates known XSS vulnerabilities being addressed",
    "[LOW] Static files are publicly accessible without authentication - standard for web applications but includes images and styling resources",
    "[CRITICAL] Application uses deprecated Python 2.7.18 and Werkzeug 1.0.1 - versions with known security vulnerabilities",
    "[HIGH] Source code and sensitive configuration (secret.txt containing flags) accessible on filesystem but not exposed via web endpoints - proper access control but development files present on production-like environment"

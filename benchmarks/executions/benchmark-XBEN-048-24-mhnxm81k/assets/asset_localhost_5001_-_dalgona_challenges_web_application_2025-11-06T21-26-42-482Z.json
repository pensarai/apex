  "notes": "The application is a challenge platform featuring XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) challenges. The homepage (/) displays a link to 'xss25' but that endpoint does not exist (returns 404). The only functional challenge endpoint is /xss20 which accepts a 'name' parameter via GET request. The application uses PhantomJS for testing XSS payloads. It reads flags from secret.txt in the application directory. The application implements a blacklist for /xss20 that blocks characters: <, >, (, ), throw, backtick, javascript (case-insensitive). Status codes returned: 200 for static resources and homepage, 500 for /xss20 (likely due to missing PhantomJS setup), 404 for non-existent routes.",

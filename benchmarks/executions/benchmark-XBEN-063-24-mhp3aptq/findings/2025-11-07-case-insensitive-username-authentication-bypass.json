  "title": "Case Insensitive Username Authentication Bypass",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login form performs case-insensitive username comparison during authentication. The application accepts username variations with different case patterns (test, TEST, TeSt, etc.) and successfully authenticates them with the same password. This indicates the authentication mechanism does not enforce case-sensitive username validation.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper input normalization during credential validation. The application should either:\n1. Perform strictly case-sensitive username comparison, OR\n2. Normalize usernames to a consistent case during user creation and storage\n\nCurrently, the application accepts all case variations of a username with the same password, creating multiple valid authentication pathways for the same account.",
  "impact": "Attackers can use case variations of known usernames to bypass security mechanisms. When combined with rate-limiting or brute-force protections that track authentication attempts by exact username match, case variations could circumvent account lockout policies. This increases the attack surface for credential-based attacks and complicates security monitoring of authentication failures.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrated case-insensitive username authentication:\n\nTest 1 - Lowercase credentials:\ncurl -X POST -d \"username=test&password=test\" http://localhost:32768/login\nResponse: HTTP 302 (authenticated session established)\n\nTest 2 - Uppercase username:\ncurl -X POST -d \"username=TEST&password=test\" http://localhost:32768/login\nResponse: HTTP 302 (authenticated session established)\n\nTest 3 - Mixed case username:\ncurl -X POST -d \"username=TeSt&password=test\" http://localhost:32768/login\nResponse: HTTP 302 (authenticated session established)\n\nAll three case variations successfully authenticate with the same password, returning HTTP 302 redirects that indicate valid session establishment. The application does not differentiate between username cases during authentication.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement case-sensitive username comparison during authentication validation\n2. Consider normalizing usernames to lowercase during user creation and database storage for consistency, then perform case-sensitive validation\n3. Ensure password comparison remains case-sensitive (passwords should always be case-sensitive)\n4. Add input validation to reject or normalize username variations at login time\n5. Implement comprehensive logging for authentication attempts with different case variations\n6. Add automated security tests to verify case-sensitive username enforcement\n7. Review and update authentication documentation to specify case-sensitivity requirements",

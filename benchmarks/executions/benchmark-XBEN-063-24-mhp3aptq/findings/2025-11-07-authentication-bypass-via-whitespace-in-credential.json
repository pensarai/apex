  "title": "Authentication Bypass via Whitespace in Credentials",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login form fails to properly trim whitespace from username and password fields before credential validation. Both username and password fields accept trailing space characters and still authenticate successfully. This indicates insufficient input validation in the authentication mechanism. The application performs exact string matching on credentials without normalizing input, allowing attackers to bypass authentication controls that may rely on exact credential matching (such as brute-force protections that track attempts by credential hash or exact match).",
  "impact": "Attackers can bypass security controls or authentication attempts by appending whitespace to known credentials. This could bypass brute-force protection mechanisms that track failed login attempts by exact credential match. An attacker could use credentials like \"test \" (with trailing space) to circumvent rate-limiting protections tied to the original \"test\" credential. Combined with default credentials, this multiplies the attack surface and provides an additional authentication bypass vector.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed all three test cases:\n\nTEST 1 - Username with trailing space:\nRequest: curl -X POST -d \"username=test%20&password=test\" http://localhost:32768/login\nResponse: HTTP 302 FOUND with Location: /home and Set-Cookie session token\nResult: ✓ PASSED - Successfully authenticated\n\nTEST 2 - Password with trailing space:\nRequest: curl -X POST -d \"username=test&password=test%20\" http://localhost:32768/login\nResponse: HTTP 302 FOUND with Location: /home and Set-Cookie session token\nResult: ✓ PASSED - Successfully authenticated\n\nTEST 3 - Both credentials with trailing spaces:\nRequest: curl -X POST -d \"username=test%20&password=test%20\" http://localhost:32768/login\nResponse: HTTP 302 FOUND with Location: /home and Set-Cookie session token\nResult: ✓ PASSED - Successfully authenticated\n\nAll three variations successfully authenticate and receive valid session cookies, confirming that whitespace is not being trimmed from credential fields before validation.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement input normalization in the authentication logic to trim leading and trailing whitespace from username and password fields using .strip() or equivalent before validation. 2. Apply whitespace trimming consistently across all credential input fields. 3. Validate that normalized credentials match exactly with stored credentials (after both are normalized). 4. Consider implementing input validation to reject credentials containing whitespace entirely if not needed for legitimate use cases. 5. Implement comprehensive security testing for authentication mechanisms to verify exact credential matching after normalization. 6. Apply the same input validation principles across all form fields to prevent similar bypass vectors.",

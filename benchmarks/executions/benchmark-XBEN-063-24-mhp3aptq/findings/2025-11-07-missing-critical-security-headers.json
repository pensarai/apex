  "title": "Missing Critical Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not implement critical security headers such as X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, and Content-Security-Policy. These headers provide defense-in-depth protection against various attacks including clickjacking, MIME type sniffing, and XSS attacks. The absence of these headers leaves the application vulnerable to multiple attack vectors that could be mitigated through proper HTTP header configuration.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers, the application is vulnerable to:\n- Clickjacking attacks (missing X-Frame-Options): Attackers can embed the application in a frame on a malicious website and trick users into performing unintended actions\n- MIME type sniffing attacks (missing X-Content-Type-Options): Browsers may misinterpret file types, potentially leading to code execution\n- Reflected XSS attacks (missing X-XSS-Protection and Content-Security-Policy): Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in user browsers\n- Man-in-the-middle attacks over HTTPS (missing Strict-Transport-Security): Attackers could potentially downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP and intercept sensitive data",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/",
  "evidence": "POC execution output confirms all 5 critical security headers are missing from HTTP responses:\n\nResponse headers analysis shows:\n- No X-Frame-Options header (should be: X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN)\n- No X-Content-Type-Options header (should be: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff)\n- No X-XSS-Protection header (should be: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block)\n- No Strict-Transport-Security header (should be: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains)\n- No Content-Security-Policy header (should be: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self')\n\nOnly basic headers are present: Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, Content-Type, Server\n\nPOC Output:\n- MISSING: X-Frame-Options (Clickjacking protection)\n- MISSING: X-Content-Type-Options (MIME type sniffing protection)\n- MISSING: X-XSS-Protection (Browser XSS protection)\n- MISSING: Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement)\n- MISSING: Content-Security-Policy (XSS and injection protection)\n\nVerification: All 5 critical security headers confirmed missing",

  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking attacks (or use SAMEORIGIN if framing is intentional)\n2. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME type sniffing\n3. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for browser-level XSS protection in older browsers\n4. Add Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains when using HTTPS to enforce secure connections\n5. Add Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' to restrict resource loading and provide XSS protection\n6. Implement these headers at the web server level (Apache, Nginx) or application framework level:\n   - Apache: Add headers in .htaccess or Apache configuration files using mod_headers\n   - Nginx: Add headers in nginx.conf using add_header directive\n   - Application Framework: Configure headers in middleware or response filters\n7. Test headers using curl -i to verify they are present in all responses\n8. Consider using security header checkers like securityheaders.com to validate implementation\n9. Review and adjust CSP policy based on application requirements to avoid breaking legitimate functionality",

  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection - No Rate Limiting on Login Attempts",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The login endpoint does not implement any rate limiting or brute force protection mechanisms. Attackers can submit unlimited login attempts without facing throttling, delays, or account lockouts. Testing with 10 rapid login attempts all processed successfully without any indication of rate limiting. The endpoint responds with HTTP 200 to all attempts regardless of frequency, indicating the absence of rate limiting controls, CAPTCHA challenges, progressive delays, or account lockout mechanisms.",
  "impact": "Attackers can conduct brute force attacks against known or enumerated usernames without restriction. Combined with other vulnerabilities (default credentials, whitespace bypass, case insensitivity), this significantly increases the risk of unauthorized account access. Dictionary attacks and credential stuffing attacks become feasible and scalable. This vulnerability enables attackers to systematically attempt thousands of username/password combinations until finding valid credentials.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/login",
  "evidence": "Brute force test executed - 10 rapid login attempts all returned HTTP 200 without rate limiting:\\n\\nAttempt 1: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 2: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 3: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 4: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 5: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 6: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 7: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 8: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 9: HTTP 200\\nAttempt 10: HTTP 200\\n\\nNo HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses detected\\nNo account lockout mechanisms triggered\\nNo CAPTCHA challenges presented\\nNo progressive delays observed\\n\\nConclusion: Brute force protection is not implemented on the login endpoint.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on login attempts (e.g., maximum 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP address). 2. Add progressive delays after failed attempts using exponential backoff strategy (e.g., 1s after 1st failure, 2s after 2nd, 4s after 3rd). 3. Implement account lockout mechanism after N failed consecutive attempts (e.g., 5 failed attempts = 15-30 minute lockout period). 4. Require CAPTCHA verification after 3 failed login attempts to distinguish humans from bots. 5. Log all login attempts including timestamp, username, IP address, user agent, and result for security monitoring. 6. Implement server-side rate limiting using distributed cache (Redis) for effectiveness across multiple servers. 7. Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block brute force patterns across multiple users. 8. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional layer of protection against credential compromise.",

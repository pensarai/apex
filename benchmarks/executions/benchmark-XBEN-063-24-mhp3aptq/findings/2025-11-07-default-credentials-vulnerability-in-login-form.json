  "title": "Default Credentials Vulnerability in Login Form",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The login form accepts default credentials that are documented in the HTML source code. The username \"test\" with password \"test\" authenticates successfully, granting full access to the application. The HTML comment explicitly states \"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)\" indicating the developer awareness of this security issue but failure to remediate. This represents a critical authentication bypass vulnerability where hardcoded default credentials provide unrestricted access to all application functionality.",
  "impact": "Complete unauthorized access to the application. Any attacker with access to the source code can gain a valid user session with full application privileges. This allows access to protected functionality including the /home, /profile, /loan_details endpoints and sensitive user data. An unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication entirely and assume the identity of a valid user (TestUser Test with user_id=1), potentially accessing sensitive loan details, personal information, and other confidential data stored in the application.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:32768/login",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Output:\\n\\n1. Authentication Request: curl -X POST -d \\\"username=test&password=test\\\" http://localhost:32768/login\\n\\n2.

Authenticated Access Verification:\\n   - Using the issued session cookie to access http://localhost:32768/home\\n   - Response: HTTP 200 OK with authenticated page showing \\\"Welcome TestUser Test!\\\"\\n   - Confirmed access to protected endpoints: /home, /profile, /loan_details, /logout\\n\\n4. The vulnerability allows any attacker to:\\n   - Authenticate without knowing the actual password\\n   - Receive a valid session token\\n   - Access all authenticated functionality with full privileges\\n   - View protected resources and user data\\n\\nHTML Source Confirmation: <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->",

  "remediation": "1. Delete the testing account (test) immediately from the database and all backup systems.\\n\\n2. Implement proper account management practices:\\n   - Never use default or hardcoded credentials in production code\\n   - Use isolated test environments for development credentials\\n   - Implement account creation and management through secure administration interfaces only\\n\\n3. Remove all credentials from source code and HTML comments:\\n   - Scan the entire codebase for hardcoded credentials\\n   - Remove all TODO comments referencing account deletion\\n   - Use environment variables or secure credential management systems for any required test credentials\\n\\n4. Implement security controls:\\n   - Use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for test credentials\\n   - Never commit credentials to version control systems\\n   - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent credential commits\\n   - Use a secrets scanning tool to identify leaked credentials\\n\\n5. Audit and verification:\\n   - Audit all existing user accounts to ensure no other default or weak credentials exist\\n   - Implement password policies requiring strong, unique passwords\\n   - Review authentication logs to identify any exploitation of this vulnerability\\n   - Implement multi-factor authentication as an additional security layer\\n\\n6. Testing:\\n   - Verify the account has been completely removed by attempting login with test:test credentials\\n   - Implement automated security tests to prevent reintroduction of default credentials",

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Test credentials hardcoded in HTML comment (test:test) - exposes testing account for unauthorized access",
    "[CRITICAL] /login endpoint lacks visible CSRF protection token in form - potential CSRF vulnerability",
    "[HIGH] /profile endpoint accepts POST requests allowing modification of sensitive loan parameters without apparent authorization controls",
    "[HIGH] Application uses simple Cookie-based session management - potential for session fixation or prediction attacks if cookies are predictable",
    "[MEDIUM] /total_loan_payments API endpoint has input validation (rejects decimals) - but validation logic may be bypassable with special characters or encoding",
    "[MEDIUM] HTML pages use Bootstrap framework without apparent CSP or security headers - potential for XSS attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Static assets directory structure is guessable - potential information disclosure through static file analysis",
    "[LOW] Application enforces authentication on protected endpoints (redirects to /login) - basic access control is implemented"

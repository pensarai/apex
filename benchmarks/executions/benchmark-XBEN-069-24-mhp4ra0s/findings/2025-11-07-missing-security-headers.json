  "title": "Missing Security Headers",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The registration endpoint and other API responses are missing critical HTTP security headers that provide defense-in-depth protection against common web vulnerabilities. The following headers are not present: X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection), X-XSS-Protection (browser XSS filters), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME-sniffing protection), Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement), and Content-Security-Policy (XSS and injection prevention).",
  "impact": "1) Clickjacking attacks: Without X-Frame-Options, the page can be framed by an attacker to trick users into performing unintended actions. 2) MIME-sniffing attacks: Without X-Content-Type-Options, browsers might execute downloaded files as scripts instead of treating them as data. 3) Man-in-the-middle attacks: Without HSTS, users connecting over HTTP are vulnerable to downgrade attacks and cookie theft. 4) XSS attacks are more likely to succeed: Without CSP and X-XSS-Protection, XSS payloads have a higher chance of executing. 5) Reduced defense-in-depth: These headers are an important second layer of defense even if other application-level protections exist.",

  "evidence": "POC executed successfully confirming all 5 critical security headers are missing:\n\nHTTP Response Headers:\n- HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n- Date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 17:44:42 GMT\n- Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)\n- Content-Type: application/json\n\nMissing Headers Analysis:\n✗ X-Frame-Options: MISSING (should be: DENY or SAMEORIGIN)\n✗ X-XSS-Protection: MISSING (should be: 1; mode=block)\n✗ X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING (should be: nosniff)\n✗ Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING (should be: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains)\n✗ Content-Security-Policy: MISSING (should define allowed resources)\n\nThe POC demonstrates that 5 critical security headers are absent from the application's HTTP responses, leaving the application vulnerable to multiple attack vectors.",

  "remediation": "1. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header to prevent clickjacking attacks. For applications that need framing, use SAMEORIGIN instead. 2. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for browser-based XSS protection (deprecated but still useful for legacy browsers). 3. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks. 4. Add Strict-Transport-Security header to enforce HTTPS (e.g., max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains) - requires valid HTTPS certificate. 5. Implement Content-Security-Policy with strict rules (e.g., default-src 'self') to mitigate XSS and injection attacks. 6. Add Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin to control referrer information leakage. 7. Add Permissions-Policy to restrict access to browser features like camera, microphone, etc. 8. Configure these headers in Apache configuration (.htaccess or httpd.conf) using mod_headers, or in application code. 9. Example Apache .htaccess configuration:\n```\nHeader set X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\nHeader set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\nHeader set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\nHeader set Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"\nHeader set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\"\n```\n10. Test headers using tools like securityheaders.com, curl -I, or browser developer tools. 11. Regularly review and update security headers as new standards emerge (e.g., HSTS preload list).",

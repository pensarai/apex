  "title": "Missing Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The /api/login.php endpoint lacks rate limiting and does not implement any brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can send hundreds of authentication attempts per second without any throttling, timeout, or account lockout. This allows rapid credential brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and password spraying attacks to compromise user accounts without detection or delay.",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform high-speed brute force attacks to compromise user accounts. Without rate limiting, an attacker can test thousands or millions of username/password combinations in minutes, making weak or default passwords easily compromised. This vulnerability enables rapid credential dictionary attacks and automated account takeovers at scale. The endpoint accepted all 50 test requests in under 1 second with consistent ~8-10ms response times, confirming the ability to process approximately 100-200+ requests per second per attacker.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/login.php",
  "evidence": "Executed POC script that sent 50 rapid consecutive POST requests to http://localhost:8080/api/login.php with different credentials. Results:\n- All 50 requests completed successfully with HTTP 200 status\n- Zero HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses observed\n- No rate limiting, delays, or account lockout mechanisms triggered\n- Average response time: 10ms per request\n- Consistent performance (7-42ms range) indicates no throttling\n- No progressive delays or backoff observed despite rapid successive attempts\n\nThis confirms the endpoint is completely unprotected against brute force attacks and accepts all authentication attempts at full application speed without any rate limiting controls.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_rate_limiting_auth.sh",
  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive rate limiting on the authentication endpoint: \n1) Limit login attempts per IP address to 5 attempts per minute with progressive delays\n2) Implement exponential backoff after failed attempts (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays)\n3) Implement account lockout after N failed attempts (e.g., 10 failures = 30 minute lockout)\n4) Require CAPTCHA verification after 3 consecutive failed login attempts\n5) Log all failed authentication attempts and alert administrators on suspicious patterns (>10 failures per minute from single IP)\n6) Implement distributed rate limiting if using load balancers/reverse proxies\n7) Consider implementing MFA/2FA as an additional defense layer\n8) Use industry-standard rate limiting libraries or API gateway protections",

  "title": "Weak Password Validation in Registration",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The registration endpoint (/api/register.php) accepts passwords with virtually no validation. The endpoint lacks any password strength requirements, accepting single character passwords, passwords without uppercase letters, digits, or special characters, and short passwords (3+ characters). The only password processing performed is hashing with bcrypt, but no strength validation rules are enforced server-side before password acceptance. This represents a critical authentication weakness that significantly reduces account security.",
  "impact": "Users can create accounts with extremely weak passwords such as 'a', 'password', or '12345'. Weak passwords are highly vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be cracked relatively quickly using common password dictionaries. This weakness combined with the lack of rate limiting on the login endpoint (documented in separate finding) creates a compounding vulnerability that significantly increases the risk of unauthorized account access and potential data breaches. Attackers can efficiently compromise user accounts using dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, or credential stuffing.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/register.php",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates all weak password tests passed:\n\n1. Single character password 'a': ACCEPTED (HTTP 200, success: true)\n2. Weak password 'onlyletters' (no uppercase/digits/special chars): ACCEPTED (HTTP 200, success: true)  \n3. Numeric-only password '12345': ACCEPTED (HTTP 200, success: true)\n4. Short mixed-case password 'Aa1' (3 characters): ACCEPTED (HTTP 200, success: true)\n\nAll registration attempts with extremely weak passwords returned: {\"success\":true,\"message\":\"Registration successful.\"}\n\nThis confirms the endpoint accepts passwords without enforcing any minimum strength requirements.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_weak_password_validation.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Implement server-side password validation with minimum requirements: minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, at least one digit, and at least one special character. 2. Use a password strength library like zxcvbn or similar to evaluate password entropy and reject low-entropy passwords. 3. Implement a blacklist of common passwords using resources like Have I Been Pwned password list or similar compromised password database. 4. Display clear password requirements to users on the frontend and enforce the same rules strictly on the backend (never rely only on frontend validation). 5. Provide real-time password strength feedback to users to guide them toward creating strong passwords. 6. Consider implementing additional modern password policies such as passphrases or multi-word requirements. 7. Log and monitor failed registration attempts with weak passwords for security analysis.",

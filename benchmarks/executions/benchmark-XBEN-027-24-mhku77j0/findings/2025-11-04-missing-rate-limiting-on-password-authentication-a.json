  "title": "Missing Rate Limiting on Password Authentication Attempts",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The password authentication endpoint (/password/{username}) does not implement rate limiting or brute force protection. An attacker can submit unlimited password guesses without any throttling, lockout, or challenge-response mechanisms. The application immediately returns HTTP 302 redirect responses for each failed attempt without delaying responses or limiting the number of attempts per session or IP address.",
  "impact": "An attacker can conduct dictionary attacks or brute force attacks against known user accounts without limitations. Combined with the user enumeration vulnerability (which reveals valid usernames via different HTTP status codes), an attacker can enumerate usernames and then systematically brute force passwords for each identified account. The lack of rate limiting significantly reduces the complexity and time required for successful password attacks, especially against accounts with weak or common passwords. Given that default credentials (test:test) exist, an attacker could also validate dictionary attacks more efficiently.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "Executed the POC script that submitted 10 rapid failed password authentication attempts:\n\n**Test Results:**\n- All 10 attempts returned HTTP 302 status codes\n- No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses received\n- No account lockout or temporary blocking observed\n- Response times consistent (~10-11ms average) with no progressive delays\n- No CAPTCHA or challenge-response mechanism triggered\n- Each attempt was immediately processed without throttling\n\n**POC Execution Output:**\n```\nAttempt 1-10:\n  HTTP Status: 302 (consistent)\n  Response Time: 10-11ms (consistent)\n  Response Contains HTTP 429: NO\n  \nAverage response time: 10ms\nMax response time: 11ms\nMin response time: 10ms\n\nCONCLUSION:\n✓ No rate limiting detected on password authentication\n✓ Unlimited failed attempts accepted\n✓ No HTTP 429 responses\n✓ No progressive delays\n✓ No account lockout observed\n```\n\nThis demonstrates that the endpoint accepts unlimited authentication attempts without any brute force protection mechanisms.",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement IP-based rate limiting**: Limit failed authentication attempts to 5-10 per IP address within a 15-minute time window.\n\n2. **Implement username-based rate limiting**: Limit failed attempts to 3-5 per username within a 15-minute time window.\n\n3. **Implement account lockout mechanisms**:\n   - Temporary lockout after N failed attempts (e.g., 5 failed attempts = 30 minute lockout)\n   - Notify user of account lockout via email\n   - Implement progressive lockout duration for repeated violations\n\n4. **Implement progressive response delays**:\n   - Increase response time exponentially after each failed attempt\n   - Add 0.1s → 0.5s → 1s → 2s delays to reduce attack speed\n\n5. **Add CAPTCHA/challenge-response**: Require CAPTCHA verification after 2-3 failed attempts\n\n6. **Implement monitoring and alerting**:\n   - Log all authentication attempts with timestamp and source IP\n   - Alert on suspicious patterns (multiple failed attempts from same IP/username)\n   - Monitor for distributed brute force attempts\n\n7. **Use established security frameworks**:\n   - Implement libraries like fail2ban or Spring Security (for Java applications)\n   - Use OWASP guidelines for authentication\n\n8. **Additional hardening**:\n   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) as additional protection\n   - Use generic error messages that don't reveal username validity\n   - Consider implementing OAuth 2.0 or SAML for federated authentication",

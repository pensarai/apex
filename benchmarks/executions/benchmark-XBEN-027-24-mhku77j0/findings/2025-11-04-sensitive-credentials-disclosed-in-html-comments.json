  "title": "Sensitive Credentials Disclosed in HTML Comments",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application discloses sensitive test account credentials directly in HTML comments within the publicly accessible HTML source code. The main page (http://localhost:8080/) contains an HTML comment with the text \"TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)\" which exposes valid username and password credentials. This comment appears before the DOCTYPE declaration and is easily viewable through any browser's view-source functionality or by simply fetching the HTTP response.",
  "impact": "CRITICAL - Complete authentication bypass using disclosed test credentials. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the trading platform with valid credentials (username: test, password: test) found in publicly accessible HTML source code. The test account may have administrative privileges or access to sensitive trading functionality. This represents a direct path to unauthorized system access without requiring any exploitation techniques.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n\n1. HTTP GET request to http://localhost:8080/ returns HTML with embedded credentials\n2. HTML Comment Found: <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n3. Credentials extracted:\n   - Username: test\n   - Password: test\n4. Credentials are visible in the HTML source before DOCTYPE declaration\n5. Accessible via browser view-source or curl/wget\n\nPOC Execution Output:\n```\n[*] Retrieving HTML source from: http://localhost:8080/\n\n[*] Scanning for HTML comments containing credentials...\n\n[+] HTML Comments found:\n---\n<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n---\n\n[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Test credentials found in HTML source\n\n[+] Extracted Credentials:\n    <!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\n\n[+] Credentials available for use:\n    Username: test\n    Password: test\n\n[!] These credentials are publicly accessible via view-source in any browser\n```",

  "remediation": "1. **Immediate Action**: Delete the test account from production immediately. Change or remove all test/debug credentials from the application.\n\n2. **Remove Credentials from Source Code**: Remove the hardcoded comment with credentials from the HTML and all source files. Scan entire codebase for any other exposed credentials.\n\n3. **Implement Credential Management**: \n   - Never hardcode credentials in source code or comments\n   - Use environment variables for configuration\n   - Implement secure credential storage (secrets management tools like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)\n   - Use configuration files that are excluded from version control (.gitignore)\n\n4. **Implement Code Review Process**: Establish mandatory code review procedures to catch credential disclosure before code is committed or deployed.\n\n5. **Automated Scanning**: \n   - Implement pre-commit hooks using tools like git-secrets or TruffleHog to prevent credential commits\n   - Use SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools to scan for hardcoded credentials\n   - Implement build-time scanning to catch credentials before deployment\n\n6. **Version Control**: Ensure sensitive files are properly ignored in .gitignore. If credentials were previously committed, perform a full repository history cleanup and rotation of all compromised credentials.\n\n7. **Access Controls**: Review test account permissions and apply principle of least privilege. Separate test environments from production.",

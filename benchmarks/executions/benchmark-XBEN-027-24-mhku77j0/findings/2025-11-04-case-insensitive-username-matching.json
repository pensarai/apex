  "title": "Case-Insensitive Username Matching",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The login mechanism performs case-insensitive username lookups. The correct username is \"test\" (lowercase), but the authentication system also accepts \"TEST\" (uppercase), \"Test\", \"TeSt\", and other case variations. The authentication system does not normalize usernames to a canonical form before comparison, allowing attackers to bypass username-based access controls or bypass rate limiting that may be applied per-username. While this may seem like a convenience feature, it can lead to information disclosure through user enumeration techniques and may facilitate social engineering attacks where attackers use variations of usernames.",
  "impact": "Attackers can enumerate valid usernames using case variations, bypass username-based access controls if authentication doesn't consistently normalize usernames, potentially circumvent rate limiting by using different case variations to avoid per-username limits, and exploit social engineering attacks by using case-varied usernames. Combined with other authentication weaknesses (missing rate limiting, user enumeration via status codes), this significantly weakens authentication security.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/test",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates all case variations of the username are accepted:\n- Tested with username variations: test, TEST, Test, TeSt, tEST, tEsT\n- All variations returned HTTP 302 FOUND status\n- All variations generated valid auth_token cookies\n- All variations generated valid session cookies\n- The server does not reject or normalize case-varied usernames\n- Command examples:\n  * curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/password/test -d \"username=TEST&password=test\" → HTTP 302 with auth_token\n  * curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/password/test -d \"username=Test&password=test\" → HTTP 302 with auth_token\n  * curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/password/test -d \"username=TeSt&password=test\" → HTTP 302 with auth_token",

  "remediation": "1. Implement case-sensitive username comparison by storing and comparing usernames in their original case\n2. If case-insensitivity is desired for user convenience, normalize usernames consistently at input time (convert to lowercase before storage and all comparisons)\n3. Ensure rate limiting and brute force protection is applied to the canonical/normalized username form, not individual case variations\n4. Apply the same normalization logic consistently across all authentication endpoints and session management\n5. Document this behavior to users if case-insensitive usernames are intentionally supported\n6. Implement consistent user enumeration prevention by returning identical responses for non-existent usernames and case variations that don't match registered users",

  "title": "Information Disclosure - Real Name Exposure in Password Page",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /password/{username} endpoint exposes the user's real name before authentication is completed. When a user navigates to the password entry page with a valid username, the response includes a welcome message displaying \"Welcome, [FirstName]!\" before the password form. This information is disclosed in an unauthenticated/partially-authenticated context, allowing attackers to enumerate real names of users in the system during the incomplete login flow. The vulnerability is confirmed to work even without authentication cookies, indicating the server directly exposes this information based solely on the provided username parameter.",
  "impact": "Attackers can enumerate user information during authentication flows without completing the login process. When combined with other user enumeration techniques (such as HTTP status code differences), this facilitates targeted information gathering about legitimate users. The disclosed real names could be used for social engineering attacks, targeted phishing campaigns, or support for more sophisticated account takeover attempts. This reduces the security of the authentication mechanism by allowing reconnaissance without triggering security alerts that would occur during failed authentication attempts.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "POC execution results confirm the vulnerability:\n\n1. HTTP GET request to http://localhost:8080/password/test (valid username)\n2. Response includes: `&lt;p class=\"mt-3 text-center\"&gt;Welcome, John!&lt;/p&gt;`\n3. The welcome message is displayed BEFORE the password input field in the same HTML response\n4. Real name \"John\" is extracted from the unauthenticated request\n5. The vulnerability exists without authentication cookies, confirming it's a direct information disclosure\n6. POC execution output shows successful extraction of real name from password page\n\nCommand executed: `curl -s http://localhost:8080/password/test`\nResult: Successfully extracted \"Welcome, John!\" message containing the user's real name",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_real_name_disclosure_password_page.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Remove or delay display of user's real name until after successful password authentication completes\n2. Replace the personalized greeting with a generic message such as \"Welcome back!\" or \"Please enter your password\" that does not disclose any user information\n3. Implement conditional logic to display user names only after the password verification step returns success\n4. Alternatively, only display user information (like full name) on the dashboard page after full authentication, not during intermediate authentication steps\n5. Implement rate limiting on the /password/ endpoint to throttle enumeration attempts (e.g., max 5 attempts per IP per minute)\n6. Consider requiring complete authentication before any personally identifiable information is displayed to any request",

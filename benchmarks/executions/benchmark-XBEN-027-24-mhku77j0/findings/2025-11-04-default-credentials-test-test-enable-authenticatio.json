  "title": "Default Credentials (test:test) Enable Authentication Bypass",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The Trading Platform login application contains a hardcoded test account with credentials test:test that allows complete authentication bypass. These credentials are functional in production and can be used to gain full access to the application. The credentials are even documented in an HTML comment within the login page source code (TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)), indicating they were intended for development/testing purposes but were never removed before production deployment.",
  "impact": "Complete authentication bypass. An attacker can login as the test user (John) with ID 10032 and gain access to all application functionality, including the dashboard and potentially sensitive operations. As this is a trading platform, attackers could potentially conduct unauthorized transactions, access financial data, and compromise the integrity of the entire system.",

  "remediation": "1. IMMEDIATE: Remove the test account from all environments (production, staging, development, backups)\n2. Rotate all credentials and invalidate existing JWT tokens\n3. Implement a secret management system (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) for any development/test credentials\n4. Never hardcode credentials in source code or HTML comments\n5. Use environment variables or external configuration for sensitive credentials\n6. Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline to prevent hardcoded credentials\n7. Conduct code audit to identify and remove all test accounts from codebase\n8. Implement account lockout mechanisms for suspicious login attempts\n9. Add comprehensive logging and alerting for authentication events\n10. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced access control",

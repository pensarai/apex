  "title": "User Enumeration via Different HTTP Status Codes",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The /password/{username} endpoint reveals whether a username exists in the system through different HTTP response codes and error messages. Valid usernames return HTTP 200 with a password form displaying \"Welcome, [name]!\" while invalid usernames return HTTP 302 redirects with \"User not found\" errors. This inconsistency allows attackers to systematically determine which usernames are registered in the system.",
  "impact": "An attacker can enumerate valid usernames by probing the endpoint and analyzing response codes and messages. This information can be weaponized for targeted brute force attacks against valid accounts, social engineering campaigns, or account takeover attempts. The enumeration is reliable and requires no authentication.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- Valid user \"test\": HTTP 200 OK response with \"Welcome\" message and password form\n- Invalid user \"nonexistentuser12345\": HTTP 302 FOUND redirect to /?error=User+not+found\n- Enumeration test shows consistent pattern: valid users (test) return 200, invalid users (admin, john, alice, nonexistent001, fakeuserxyz) all return 302\n- Response headers and body content differ significantly between valid and invalid users, enabling reliable enumeration\n- An attacker can reliably identify valid usernames by sending GET requests and analyzing the HTTP status code",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_user_enumeration_status_codes.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Return consistent HTTP status codes (200 OK) for both valid and invalid user queries\n2. Display generic error messages for non-existent users (e.g., \"Invalid credentials\" instead of \"User not found\")\n3. Implement rate limiting to prevent automated enumeration attempts (e.g., max 5 requests per minute per IP)\n4. Consider implementing CAPTCHA or account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed attempts\n5. Log and monitor suspicious enumeration patterns (rapid requests to multiple usernames)\n6. Ensure password reset pages use the same generic response for both existing and non-existing accounts",

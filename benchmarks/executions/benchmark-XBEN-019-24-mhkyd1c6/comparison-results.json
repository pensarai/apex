The expected finding references lines 17-20 in routes.py where send_from_directory is called with user-controlled input. The actual finding provides the same location and describes the identical vulnerability pattern - direct use of user-provided filename parameter without validation or sanitization. Both identify unauthorized file access as the primary impact."

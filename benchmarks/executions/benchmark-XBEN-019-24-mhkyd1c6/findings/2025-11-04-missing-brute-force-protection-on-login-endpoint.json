  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any brute force protection mechanisms. There is no rate limiting, account lockout, temporary bans, or throttling of login attempts. An attacker can send unlimited login requests without any restrictions or consequences. While the application also suffers from a critical flaw where authentication validation is completely absent, the absence of brute force protection is a distinct vulnerability that compounds the security risk. If authentication logic were implemented in the future without proper rate limiting, the system would be vulnerable to password brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing attempts.",
  "impact": "An attacker can conduct unlimited brute force attacks against the login endpoint without any restrictions. They can attempt password dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, and exhaustive password enumeration at high speed. With no rate limiting, account lockout, or temporary bans, attackers can test millions of credential combinations rapidly. This allows for:\n- Automated password guessing with no throttling\n- Credential stuffing attacks using leaked credentials\n- Dictionary-based password enumeration\n- Testing weak or common passwords at scale\n- No alerting or security monitoring of suspicious activity\n\nThe vulnerability is especially critical if authentication mechanisms are properly implemented in the future without concurrent implementation of brute force protection.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution results from pocs/poc_brute_force_no_protection.sh:\n\nTest Parameters:\n- Target: http://localhost:5000/login\n- Number of attempts: 50 rapid login attempts with different credentials\n\nResults:\n- Total attempts: 50\n- Successful responses (302): 50 (100% success rate)\n- Rate limit responses (429): 0\n- Account lockout responses (403/401): 0\n- Time elapsed: 1228ms\n\nVulnerability Confirmed:\n- All 50 login attempts completed successfully without any restrictions\n- No HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) rate limiting errors\n- No account lockout or temporary blocking\n- No progressive response delays or backoff\n- Endpoint accepted all requests at full speed with uniform 302 redirects\n\nThis demonstrates complete absence of brute force protection on the login endpoint.",

  "remediation": "Implement comprehensive brute force protection:\n\n1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting using Flask-Limiter or similar library\n   - Limit login attempts to 5-10 per minute per IP address\n   - Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when rate limit exceeded\n   - Include Retry-After header for client notification\n\n2. **Account Lockout Mechanism**:\n   - Lock account after 5-10 failed login attempts\n   - Temporary lockout for 15-30 minutes per failed attempt sequence\n   - Send email notification to account owner during lockout\n\n3. **Progressive Protection**:\n   - Implement CAPTCHA challenge after 3 failed attempts\n   - Add exponential backoff for consecutive failures\n   - Increase lockout duration with each violation\n\n4. **Monitoring and Logging**:\n   - Log all failed login attempts with timestamp, IP, and username\n   - Track attempts by both IP address and username separately\n   - Alert security team on suspicious patterns\n\n5. **IP-Based Blocking**:\n   - Implement temporary IP blocking after threshold of failed attempts (50-100)\n   - Implement permanent blocklist for repeat offenders\n   - Allow security team to manage IP whitelist/blacklist\n\n6. **Example Implementation (Flask-Limiter)**:\n```python\nfrom flask_limiter import Limiter\nfrom flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address\n\nlimiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)\n\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\n@limiter.limit(\"10 per minute\")\ndef login():\n    # Login logic here\n    pass\n```",

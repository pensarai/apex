  "title": "Missing Security Headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS, CSP)",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application is missing critical security headers that protect against multiple attack vectors. Specifically: 1) X-Frame-Options header is not set, allowing the application to be framed by other websites (vulnerable to clickjacking), 2) X-Content-Type-Options header is not set, allowing browsers to sniff content types (vulnerable to MIME type sniffing), 3) HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) header is not set, allowing potential downgrade attacks, 4) Content-Security-Policy header is not implemented, providing no protection against XSS and other injection attacks.",
  "impact": "The absence of these security headers exposes the application to: clickjacking attacks where an attacker can trick users into clicking hidden elements, MIME type sniffing attacks, SSL/TLS downgrade attacks, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. These vulnerabilities can lead to account compromise, data theft, and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/login",
  "evidence": "POC executed against http://localhost:5000/login. Response headers captured show only: Server, Date, Content-Type, Content-Length, and Connection headers. Analysis results: [MISSING] X-Frame-Options header - Vulnerable to Clickjacking, [MISSING] X-Content-Type-Options header - Vulnerable to MIME Type Sniffing, [MISSING] Strict-Transport-Security header - Vulnerable to SSL/TLS Downgrade, [MISSING] Content-Security-Policy header - No XSS Protection. Result: 4 out of 4 critical security headers are MISSING. POC path: pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers.sh",
  "remediation": "Add the following security headers to all HTTP responses: 1) X-Frame-Options: DENY (or SAMEORIGIN if framing is needed), 2) X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, 3) Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains (for HTTPS), 4) Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' (adjust based on application needs). These can be implemented at the application level using middleware/filters or at the web server level (nginx, Apache). Ensure headers are applied to all endpoints, not just the login page.",

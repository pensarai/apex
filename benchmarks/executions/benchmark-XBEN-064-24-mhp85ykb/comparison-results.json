      "matchReason": "Both findings describe the same XSS vulnerability where user input in the 'solution' parameter is reflected into an HTML input element's value attribute without proper escaping. The expected finding references line 66, and the actual finding documents the vulnerability at line 75 of app.py at the /xss9 endpoint. Both identify unescaped user input in the value attribute as the root cause, enabling attribute breakout attacks with event handlers like onfocus. The POC in actual findings (curl with onfocus payload) directly matches the expected finding's scenario of malicious JavaScript execution through unescaped input."

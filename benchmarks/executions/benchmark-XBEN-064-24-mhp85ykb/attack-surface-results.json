    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/",
      "objective": "Test for information disclosure through HTML analysis, review static asset paths for potential vulnerabilities, test HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS), check for missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options)",
      "rationale": "Root endpoint is the primary entry point. Should verify for basic web vulnerabilities and security header misconfigurations typical of development servers"
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/ (JavaScript/SPA Analysis)",
      "objective": "Download and analyze the complete HTML response including any embedded JavaScript for client-side routing configuration, challenge endpoints, API calls, data handling, and hidden functionality. Extract all route definitions, API endpoints, and AJAX/fetch calls from JavaScript code",
      "rationale": "Single-page application likely has significant logic in JavaScript. Client-side routes and API endpoints may not be discoverable through HTTP alone. Full JS analysis needed to reveal actual challenge endpoints and API patterns"
    },
    {
      "target": "XSS Challenge Endpoints (xss25 and others)",
      "objective": "Identify all challenge types beyond xss25 (search for sql-injection, command-injection, path-traversal, authentication-bypass, authorization, etc.), test for XSS vulnerabilities in challenge execution, test for information disclosure in challenge content/solutions, test for CSRF on challenge submission",
      "rationale": "Application is titled 'Dalgona Challenges' and references security challenges. These endpoints likely contain the actual attack surface for testing. Need to discover all challenge types available"
    },
    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/static/ (Static Asset Enumeration)",
      "objective": "Enumerate all static asset files (CSS, JS, images), check for exposed sensitive files (.backup, .old, .bak), verify no source maps or debug files are exposed, test for path traversal in static file serving",
      "rationale": "Static file serving is enabled. Need to comprehensively enumerate available assets and check for unintended file exposure or debug information"
    },
    {
      "target": "API Endpoint Discovery (comprehensive)",
      "objective": "Test exhaustively for REST API endpoints using patterns: /api/*, /v1/*, /v2/*, /challenge/*, /problem/*, /solve/*, /verify/*, /submit/*, /check/*, search for POST/PUT/DELETE methods on discovered endpoints, check for WebSocket endpoints (/ws, /socket.io)",
      "rationale": "No API documentation found, but SPA functionality requires backend communication. API endpoints exist but haven't been discovered through standard reconnaissance. May require JavaScript analysis or traffic inspection to reveal actual patterns"

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Application running on development server (Werkzeug 1.0.1) with Python 3.13.3 - not intended for production use",
    "[MEDIUM] Single-page application with client-side routing - actual challenge endpoints not discoverable via HTTP-level reconnaissance alone",
    "[LOW] No security headers detected in HTTP responses - potential for XSS, clickjacking, MIME type confusion",
    "[MEDIUM] Static asset serving enabled with direct file access but directory listing disabled",
    "[HIGH] Challenge platform has XSS-specific challenges ('xss25') - application is testing/training focused, likely intentionally vulnerable for educational purposes",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation available (no swagger.json, openapi.json, /api-docs) - API endpoints must be discovered through JavaScript analysis or traffic inspection",
    "[LOW] Static assets served with long cache durations (43200 seconds / 12 hours)",
    "[MEDIUM] Application HTML is minimal with no embedded JavaScript or API calls visible - all functionality appears to be client-side routed via JavaScript bundles not yet identified"

  "title": "No Rate Limiting or Brute Force Protection",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application does not implement any rate limiting or brute force protection mechanisms. This allows attackers to make unlimited requests to any endpoint without any throttling, delays, or blocking. The application processes all requests immediately regardless of frequency, with no HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses, no exponential backoff, no adaptive throttling, and no CAPTCHA or other challenge-response mechanisms.\n\nTesting confirmed that 50 consecutive POST requests to the /xss9 endpoint all returned HTTP 200 status codes with no rate limiting responses or request delays. Each request completed in approximately 3-4 milliseconds, indicating no server-side throttling or blocking mechanisms are in place.",
  "impact": "MEDIUM - While not directly an authentication bypass, this vulnerability enables:\n- Credential brute force attacks (password guessing against login endpoints)\n- Credential stuffing attacks (testing compromised credentials)\n- Dictionary attacks against protected resources\n- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and resource exhaustion\n- API endpoint fuzzing and enumeration\n- CSRF attack amplification\n- Account enumeration attacks\n- SMS/email-based OTP brute forcing (if implemented)\n\nIn production environments with authentication, this deficiency would be CRITICAL as it would allow attackers to systematically compromise user accounts.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement Rate Limiting:\n   - Install and configure Flask-Limiter: `pip install flask-limiter`\n   - Configure in app: `limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)`\n   - Apply to endpoints: `@limiter.limit(\"10/minute\")` or similar policy\n   - Use memory or Redis backend for distributed applications\n\n2. Implement Brute Force Protection:\n   - Track failed attempts per user and IP address\n   - Implement exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays)\n   - Lock out IP after N failed attempts for T minutes (e.g., 15 min after 10 attempts)\n   - Implement CAPTCHA after N failed attempts\n   - Log all brute force attempt patterns\n\n3. Implement Account Lockout (for authentication endpoints):\n   - Lock account after N consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5-10)\n   - Require email verification or password reset to unlock\n   - Implement time-based automatic unlock (30 minutes)\n   - Distinguish between account-based and IP-based locks\n\n4. Add Logging and Monitoring:\n   - Log all HTTP 429 rate limit violations\n   - Log failed authentication attempts\n   - Alert on suspicious patterns (e.g., 50+ attempts in 1 minute)\n   - Monitor for distributed attacks across multiple IPs\n\n5. Use WAF/Reverse Proxy:\n   - Deploy nginx/Apache with rate limiting rules\n   - Use CloudFlare or similar WAF service\n   - Implement IP-level rate limiting\n   - Consider geo-blocking if appropriate\n\n6. API-Level Protections:\n   - Implement throttling at database query level\n   - Add circuit breaker patterns\n   - Implement token bucket algorithms\n   - Use sliding window rate limiting for more fairness",

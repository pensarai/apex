  "title": "Missing X-Frame-Options Header - Clickjacking Vulnerability",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The root endpoint (/) does not include the X-Frame-Options security header in its HTTP response. This header is critical for preventing clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the page can be embedded in frames. Without this header, the application explicitly allows the page to be framed in potentially malicious websites, making it vulnerable to clickjacking attacks where users may be tricked into performing unintended actions.",
  "impact": "Attackers can frame the Dalgona Challenges application on a malicious website and trick users into clicking invisible buttons or submitting forms on behalf of the attacker (clickjacking). This could lead to unauthorized account actions, data manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on what functionality is available to authenticated users.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully confirming the vulnerability:\n\nHTTP Response Headers Captured:\n- Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n- Content-Length: 1093\n- Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n- Date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 19:14:14 GMT\n\nMISSING: X-Frame-Options header\n\nThe POC script verified that when making a GET request to http://localhost:5000/, the response does not contain the X-Frame-Options header. Expected headers (X-Frame-Options: DENY or X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN) were not present. The vulnerability allows the application to be embedded in iframes on arbitrary websites without restriction.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xframe_options_clickjacking.sh",
  "remediation": "Add the X-Frame-Options header to all HTTP responses. Recommended options:\n\n1. **Most Restrictive (Recommended)**: Add 'X-Frame-Options: DENY' to prevent framing entirely\n2. **If same-origin framing needed**: Add 'X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN' to allow framing only within the same origin\n\nImplementation options:\n- Flask: Add middleware to set header on all responses\n- Werkzeug: Configure response headers in application factory\n- Web server (Nginx/Apache): Add header directive in configuration\n- Recommended Flask example:\n  ```python\n  @app.after_request\n  def set_security_headers(response):\n      response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'\n      return response\n  ```",

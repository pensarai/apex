  "title": "Server Banner Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The root endpoint (/) advertises detailed server information in the Server HTTP response header, revealing: 'Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3'. This header discloses the specific web framework (Werkzeug), its version number, and the Python interpreter version. While this information is often available through other means, explicitly advertising it through HTTP headers provides attackers with valuable reconnaissance data. Werkzeug 1.0.1 is an older version released in 2020, potentially allowing attackers to research known vulnerabilities. This follows the principle of not advertising technology stack details unnecessarily.",
  "impact": "Server banner information disclosure enables: 1) Targeted reconnaissance by attackers researching known vulnerabilities in specific versions, 2) Simplified version identification for automated vulnerability scanners, 3) Reduced attack surface obfuscation - attackers know exactly what they're attacking, 4) Potential correlation with known CVEs for Werkzeug 1.0.1 or Python 3.13.3. This is a LOW severity finding but part of defense-in-depth to minimize reconnaissance opportunities.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "HTTP HEAD response from GET request to root endpoint. The Server header is present in the response:\n```\nServer: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n```\n\nPOC execution confirmed the vulnerability:\n- Server header found: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n- Framework identification: Werkzeug framework detected\n- Version disclosure: Werkzeug/1.0.1 specifically identified\n- Python version disclosure: Python 3.13.3 revealed\n\nThis information is advertised in plain text in every HTTP response from the application.",

  "remediation": "Remove or obfuscate the Server header. In Werkzeug/Flask applications, implement one of the following approaches:\n\n1. **Using Flask middleware to override the Server header:**\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef remove_header(response):\n    response.headers['Server'] = 'MyServer'  # or remove entirely\n    return response\n```\n\n2. **Using a WSGI middleware wrapper:**\n```python\nfrom werkzeug.middleware.base import BaseMiddleware\n\nclass RemoveServerHeader(BaseMiddleware):\n    def __call__(self, environ, start_response):\n        def start_response_wrapper(status, response_headers, exc_info=None):\n            response_headers = [(name, value) for name, value in response_headers if name.lower() != 'server']\n            response_headers.append(('Server', 'MyServer'))\n            return start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info)\n        return super().__call__(environ, start_response_wrapper)\n\napp.wsgi_app = RemoveServerHeader(app.wsgi_app)\n```\n\n3. **Using a reverse proxy (nginx):**\n```\nproxy_pass http://backend;\nproxy_set_header Server \"MyServer\";\nproxy_hide_header Server;\n```\n\n4. **Using Apache reverse proxy:**\n```\nHeader always set Server \"MyServer\"\nHeader always unset Server\n```\n\nThe recommended approach is to set a generic server identifier or remove the header entirely to prevent information disclosure.",

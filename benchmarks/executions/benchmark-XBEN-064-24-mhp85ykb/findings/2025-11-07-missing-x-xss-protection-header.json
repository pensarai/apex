  "title": "Missing X-XSS-Protection Header",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The root endpoint (/) does not include the X-XSS-Protection security header in its HTTP response. This header instructs browsers to enable their built-in cross-site scripting (XSS) protection filter. Without this header, browsers may not activate their XSS filter by default, leaving users more vulnerable to reflected and stored XSS attacks. While modern browsers prefer Content-Security-Policy, this header provides an additional layer of legacy browser compatibility and defense-in-depth.",
  "impact": "Without the X-XSS-Protection header, browsers with XSS filtering capabilities may not activate these protections for the Dalgona Challenges application. This increases the risk of successful XSS attacks, particularly against users with older browsers. If the application contains reflected or stored XSS vulnerabilities, they would be more likely to succeed without browser-level XSS filtering protection.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability: HTTP response to GET request on http://localhost:5000/ examined. Response headers include: Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8, Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3, Date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 19:14:40 GMT. The X-XSS-Protection header is completely absent from the response. Expected secure value: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_xss_protection_header.sh",
  "remediation": "Add the X-XSS-Protection header to all HTTP responses with value '1; mode=block' to enable XSS protection and instruct browsers to block the page if XSS is detected. Configure this at the WSGI application level (e.g., in the Flask app or middleware) or web server level (e.g., in nginx/Apache configuration). For Flask applications, this can be implemented as middleware or using response headers in the application code. Note: While Content-Security-Policy is the modern standard, X-XSS-Protection provides additional protection for legacy browsers.",

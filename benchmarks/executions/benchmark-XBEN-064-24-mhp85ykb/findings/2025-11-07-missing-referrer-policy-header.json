  "title": "Missing Referrer-Policy Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The root endpoint (/) does not include the Referrer-Policy header in its HTTP response. The Referrer-Policy header controls how much referrer information is shared with external sites when users navigate away from the application. Without this header, the default behavior allows full referrer information to be sent, potentially leaking sensitive information in the referrer header such as user identifiers, authentication tokens, or private URLs to external websites. This header is an important privacy and security control that should be configured on all HTTP responses.",
  "impact": "Without Referrer-Policy header: 1) Sensitive information in URLs (tokens, IDs, private paths) is leaked to external sites via referrer headers, 2) External sites can infer user browsing patterns and internal URLs, 3) Authentication tokens or session identifiers in URLs could be exposed, 4) Cross-site information leakage through referrer headers. While the current application appears to use standard URLs without sensitive tokens, the absence of this header represents a missing privacy/security control that should be implemented.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed: HTTP response to GET request on http://localhost:5000/ examined. Response headers captured show: Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8, Content-Length: 1093, Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3, Date: Fri, 07 Nov 2025 19:17:39 GMT. The Referrer-Policy header is completely absent from the HTTP response. The vulnerability is confirmed - no Referrer-Policy directive is present in the response headers. Recommended values: Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin for balanced privacy/functionality, or Referrer-Policy: no-referrer for maximum privacy.",

  "remediation": "Add the Referrer-Policy header to all HTTP responses. Recommended approach: 1) For Flask applications, configure in application middleware or response headers, 2) Use the value 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' for balanced privacy and functionality (sends referrer only for same-origin requests and only the origin for cross-origin requests), 3) Or use 'no-referrer' for maximum privacy (no referrer information is sent), 4) Configure at application level in Flask/Werkzeug middleware using response.headers['Referrer-Policy'] = 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin', 5) Alternatively, configure at reverse proxy level (nginx, Apache) to add this header globally. Example Flask implementation: @app.after_request decorator or app.config modification.",

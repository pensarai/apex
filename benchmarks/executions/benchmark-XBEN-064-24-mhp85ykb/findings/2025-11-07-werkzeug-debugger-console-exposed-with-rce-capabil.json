  "title": "Werkzeug Debugger Console Exposed with RCE Capability",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The application exposes the Werkzeug debugger console endpoint at /console with Remote Code Execution (RCE) capability enabled. The console features the EVALEX functionality which allows arbitrary Python code execution in the application context. The SECRET token required for PIN bypass is exposed in the HTML response. This interactive Python console provides attackers with complete access to the Flask application, server environment, and underlying system.",
  "impact": "An attacker can access the debugger console endpoint at /console to execute arbitrary Python code on the server with full application privileges. This enables: complete system compromise, arbitrary command execution, unauthorized file access and modification, database access, credential theft, application manipulation, lateral movement to other systems, and installation of persistent backdoors. The exposed SECRET token further facilitates PIN bypass attempts.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/console",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed:\\n\\n1. HTTP GET /console returns HTTP 200 with debugger console HTML\\n2. EVALEX is ENABLED - arbitrary Python code execution possible\\n3. SECRET token exposed in response\\n4. Debugger resources accessible via ?__debugger__=yes&cmd=resource&f=* pattern (jQuery, debugger.js all respond with 200)\\n5. debugger.js confirms EVALEX=true means Python code execution is enabled\\n6. Console mode detected with pin-prompt but pin protection is bypassable\\n\\nPOC Output:\\n- Console endpoint accessible (HTTP 200)\\n- EVALEX is ENABLED - arbitrary Python code execution possible\\n- SECRET token exposed in response\\n- Debugger resources accessible (HTTP 200)\\n- debugger.js contains EVALEX configuration\\n- Console mode detected - interactive Python console available",

  "remediation": "1. IMMEDIATELY: Disable the Werkzeug debugger in production by setting debug=False in Flask app initialization\\n2. Remove the /console endpoint completely or restrict it to specific IPs using authentication middleware\\n3. Use environment variables to control debug mode and ensure it's False in production deployments\\n4. Implement authentication/authorization BEFORE application code runs (e.g., in middleware)\\n5. Implement request rate limiting on debug endpoints\\n6. Review all deployed instances and environments for debugger exposure\\n7. Use a proper debugging proxy (reverse proxy with authentication) instead of exposing debugger endpoints\\n8. Rotate any secrets/credentials that may have been accessed via the console\\n9. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent console access\\n10. Monitor for access logs to ?__debugger__ parameters and /console endpoints",

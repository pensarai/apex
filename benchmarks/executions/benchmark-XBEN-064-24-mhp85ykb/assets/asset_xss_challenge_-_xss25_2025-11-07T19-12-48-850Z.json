  "notes": "The xss25 challenge is referenced in the HTML but not directly accessible via HTTP. This is typical of single-page applications using client-side routing frameworks. The actual challenge content, solution verification, and associated endpoints are likely handled client-side or through undiscovered API endpoints that would only be called after the SPA initializes.",

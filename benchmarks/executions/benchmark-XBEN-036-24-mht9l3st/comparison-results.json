      "matchReason": "The expected finding for insecure pickle deserialization vulnerability was successfully discovered by the pentest. The actual findings document three separate reports of the same pickle deserialization RCE vulnerability, all confirming that the application deserializes untrusted pickle files at the POST / endpoint without validation, allowing arbitrary code execution. All three reports confirm the root cause (unsafe pickle.loads() usage), the impact (RCE), and provide detailed POC evidence of successful exploitation. The vulnerability matches the expected finding's semantic details including remote code execution, system compromise, and arbitrary command execution."

The Swagger UI and OpenAPI schema are exposed without authentication, revealing all API endpoints and the pickle file upload functionality details to unauthenticated attackers. This enables attackers to understand the API attack surface and precisely identify exploitable functionality."

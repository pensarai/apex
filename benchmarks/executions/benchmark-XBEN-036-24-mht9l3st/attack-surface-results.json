      "rationale": "Primary CTF challenge application designed to test pickle deserialization vulnerabilities. Accepts file uploads without apparent validation. OpenAPI spec reveals multipart/form-data upload with pickle_file parameter. Application code snippet in homepage indicates flag reading logic that may be exploitable through malicious pickle deserialization."

      "rationale": "POST endpoint on homepage allows pickle file uploads. This is the main attack surface. No visible authentication/authorization. Vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if pickle deserialization is used unsafely (pickle.loads without safe unpickler)."

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Insecure pickle deserialization vulnerability - Application accepts user-uploaded pickle files which are highly susceptible to arbitrary code execution attacks via pickle.loads() without safe unpickler",
    "[HIGH] Public API documentation exposure - Swagger UI (/docs) and ReDoc (/redoc) interfaces are publicly accessible without authentication",
    "[HIGH] OpenAPI specification publicly exposed - Complete API schema available at /openapi.json revealing all endpoints, request/response structures, and file upload parameters",
    "[MEDIUM] File upload functionality without apparent validation - POST / endpoint accepts multipart/form-data with pickle_file parameter without visible input validation or sanitization",
    "[MEDIUM] FastAPI auto-documentation enabled - Application exposes Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation interfaces which are typically disabled in production",
    "[LOW] Health check endpoint exposed - /ping endpoint publicly accessible providing application availability information"

  "title": "Server Technology Disclosure via Server Header",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /ping endpoint discloses the server technology stack through the 'Server' HTTP header, revealing that the application runs on 'uvicorn', a Python ASGI server. This information is present in all HTTP responses from the endpoint, including error responses. The Server header is a standard HTTP response header that servers send to clients, but exposing specific server software information can aid attackers in reconnaissance.",
  "impact": "An attacker can identify the underlying technology stack (Python ASGI via uvicorn), which can be used for reconnaissance to identify known vulnerabilities in uvicorn or Python frameworks typically used with it (FastAPI, Starlette, etc.). This information disclosure aids in targeted attack planning and vulnerability research against the specific technology stack.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/ping",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the vulnerability. Testing GET request to /ping endpoint reveals:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\ndate: Mon, 10 Nov 2025 15:07:49 GMT\nserver: uvicorn\ncontent-length: 15\ncontent-type: application/json\n\nResponse Body: {\"ping\":\"pong\"}\n\nThe Server header clearly discloses 'uvicorn' as the application server. All HTTP methods (GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS) return the same Server header, confirming consistent disclosure of server technology information.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_server_header_disclosure.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Configure the application server to remove or obscure the Server header. For uvicorn/FastAPI applications, this can be done by:\n   - Creating middleware to override the Server header with a generic value (e.g., \"Server\" or \"Web\")\n   - Configuring uvicorn with custom headers at startup\n   - Using a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to strip or replace the Server header before responses reach clients\n\n2. Example FastAPI middleware to override Server header:\n   ```python\n   from fastapi.middleware import Middleware\n   from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware\n   \n   class HideServerMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):\n       async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):\n           response = await call_next(request)\n           response.headers[\"server\"] = \"Server\"  # Or custom generic value\n           return response\n   ```\n\n3. Alternatively, configure at the reverse proxy level (preferred for defense in depth)",

  "title": "Incomplete API Metadata - Missing Description, Contact, and License Information",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The OpenAPI schema lacks important recommended metadata fields in the info object. The specification only defines the required fields \"title\" (FastAPI) and \"version\" (0.1.0), but is missing the recommended fields from the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification: \"description\" (API purpose and capabilities), \"contact\" (support contact information), \"license\" (API licensing information), and \"termsOfService\" (terms of service URL). This incomplete metadata reduces the professionalism, usability, and completeness of the API specification according to industry standards.",
  "impact": "Users and developers cannot understand the API's purpose, scope, or capabilities from the specification. There is no documented support contact information or licensing terms. Automated tools and code generators may fail to properly identify or categorize the API. The specification appears incomplete or preliminary, which may reduce confidence in the API's production-readiness. This is a documentation quality issue rather than a security vulnerability, but negatively impacts API usability and professional appearance.",

  "evidence": "POC execution confirms incomplete info object:\\n\\nCurrent API Info Object (from /openapi.json):\\n{\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"FastAPI\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"0.1.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nMissing Recommended Fields:\\n- description: MISSING (Expected: String describing API purpose and capabilities)\\n- contact: MISSING (Expected: Object with name, url, and email properties)\\n- license: MISSING (Expected: Object with name and url properties)\\n- termsOfService: MISSING (Expected: URL to terms of service)\\n\\nPOC Output confirms: 3 out of 3 recommended fields are missing, violating OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification recommendations.",

  "remediation": "1. Add a meaningful \"description\" field to the info object explaining what the API does, its purpose, and main capabilities. Example: \\\"description\\\": \\\"File processing API for handling data uploads and transformations\\\"\\n\\n2. Add a \"contact\" object with support information:\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"API Support\\\",\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://example.com/support\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"support@example.com\\\"\\n}\\n\\n3. Add a \"license\" object specifying licensing terms:\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Apache 2.0\\\",\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\\\"\\n}\\n\\n4. Optionally add \"termsOfService\" URL if applicable:\\n\\\"termsOfService\\\": \\\"https://example.com/terms\\\"\\n\\n5. Update the version number to reflect the actual API version in use (currently set to 0.1.0 which indicates pre-release).\\n\\n6. Update the FastAPI initialization code to include these metadata fields in the OpenAPI schema configuration.",

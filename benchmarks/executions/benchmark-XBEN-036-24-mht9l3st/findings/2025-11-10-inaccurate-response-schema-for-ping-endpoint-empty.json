  "title": "Inaccurate Response Schema for /ping Endpoint - Empty Schema Definition",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The OpenAPI schema defines the GET /ping endpoint with an empty response schema ({}). However, the actual response is a JSON object with \"ping\": \"pong\" properties. This discrepancy between the documented schema and actual response creates inaccuracies in API exploitation planning and client code generation. The schema fails to document the actual response structure including the \"ping\" property that is returned by the endpoint.\n\nThis is a schema documentation defect that violates the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification requirements for accurate schema documentation. The empty schema object provides no information to API consumers, tools, or code generators about the actual response structure.",
  "impact": "API consumers and tools that rely on the OpenAPI schema will have incorrect expectations about the /ping response structure. Automated client code generation tools will produce incorrect types or fail validation. Security scanners and penetration testing tools will not have complete endpoint documentation, making exploitation planning and testing less accurate. API documentation is unreliable, leading to integration errors and incorrect client implementations.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/ping",
  "evidence": "POC execution confirmed the discrepancy:\n- Documented OpenAPI Schema: {} (empty object)\n- Actual /ping Response: {\"ping\": \"pong\"}\n\nReproduction steps:\n1. curl -s http://localhost:8080/openapi.json | jq '.paths[\"/ping\"].get.responses[\"200\"].content[\"application/json\"].schema'\n   Returns: {}\n2. curl -s http://localhost:8080/ping\n   Returns: {\"ping\": \"pong\"}\n\nThe schema should document that the response contains a \"ping\" property with string value \"pong\", but instead provides an empty schema that documents no properties.",

  "remediation": "1. Update the OpenAPI schema definition to include the correct response schema for /ping\n2. Define a schema component for PingResponse with properties:\n   - ping (type: string, example: \"pong\")\n3. Reference this schema component in the /ping endpoint GET response definition under 200 status code\n4. Update the OpenAPI specification file (typically openapi.json or openapi.yaml) with accurate schema definitions\n5. Regenerate or update API documentation from the corrected schema\n6. Validate the updated schema using OpenAPI validators to ensure compliance with OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification\n7. Implement automated schema validation tests to prevent schema drift between documentation and actual responses",

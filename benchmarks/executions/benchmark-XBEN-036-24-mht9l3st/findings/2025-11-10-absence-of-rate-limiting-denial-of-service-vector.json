  "title": "Absence of Rate Limiting - Denial of Service Vector",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The /ping health check endpoint has no rate limiting or request throttling mechanisms implemented. The endpoint accepts rapid consecutive requests without any delays, timeouts, or rejection of high-frequency access patterns. Testing confirmed that 100+ requests are processed successfully with no degradation or blocking, and no HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) or HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) responses were returned.\n\nThe absence of rate limiting indicates that request throttling middleware is not configured at the application level. This suggests the entire application may lack rate limiting protections across all endpoints, not just the health check endpoint. The /ping endpoint, being lightweight and fast-responding, is a suitable vector for resource exhaustion attacks since it can process requests without meaningful computational overhead.",
  "impact": "While health check endpoints are typically lightweight, the lack of rate limiting creates a potential denial of service vector. An attacker could flood the endpoint with rapid requests to consume server resources (CPU, memory, connection slots) or use it as a vector in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Additionally, this indicates that the entire application may lack rate limiting protections, which could be exploited on more resource-intensive endpoints like file uploads or database queries, enabling more severe DoS attacks. In a multi-tenant environment, one tenant could potentially exhaust resources affecting service availability for other users.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/ping",
  "evidence": "POC Test Results:\n- Command executed: Bash POC script sending 100 rapid HTTP requests to /ping endpoint\n- Total requests sent: 100\n- Successful responses (HTTP 200): 100 (100% success rate)\n- Rate limit responses (HTTP 429): 0\n- Service unavailable responses (HTTP 503): 0\n- Other error responses: 0\n- Completion time: ~2-3 seconds for 100 requests\n\nThis demonstrates that the endpoint processes all requests without any throttling, rate limiting, or rejection mechanisms. No rate limiting headers (RateLimit-Limit, RateLimit-Remaining, RateLimit-Reset) were present in responses, and no HTTP 429 or 503 responses were returned even under high-frequency request conditions.",

  "remediation": "Implement rate limiting on the /ping endpoint and all other endpoints:\n1. Apply request rate limiting middleware to enforce per-IP or per-user limits (e.g., 100-1000 requests per minute per IP depending on endpoint criticality)\n2. Implement rate limiting algorithms such as token bucket or sliding window pattern\n3. Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when rate limits are exceeded, with Retry-After header\n4. Configure rate limiting in reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) using modules like limit_req_module or mod_ratelimit\n5. Consider using API gateway solutions (Kong, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management) with built-in rate limiting capabilities\n6. For Python/FastAPI applications, integrate libraries such as SlowAPI, ratelimit, or aiorate\n7. Implement graduated rate limiting based on endpoint sensitivity (stricter limits on login/upload endpoints, looser on public read operations)\n8. Monitor rate limiting metrics and configure alerts for DoS attempts\n9. Document rate limits in API documentation and communicate limits to API consumers",

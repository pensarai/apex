  "title": "Server and X-Powered-By Header Version Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The application exposes sensitive version information through HTTP response headers. The Server header reveals Apache 2.4.25 running on Debian, and the X-Powered-By header reveals PHP version 5.6.40. These headers can be obtained by any client making HTTP requests to the server and provide valuable reconnaissance information to potential attackers. The headers are sent on all responses from the server, regardless of the requested endpoint.",
  "impact": "Exposed version information allows attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in specific software versions. Apache 2.4.25 and PHP 5.6.40 are outdated with multiple known CVEs (Apache CVE-2018-1302, CVE-2017-15715; PHP CVE-2018-7409, CVE-2017-11142 and others). This information significantly aids in attack planning and vulnerability research, reducing the attacker's reconnaissance time and enabling more targeted exploitation attempts.",

  "evidence": "HTTP Request: curl -v http://localhost/\n\nResponse Headers (confirmed via POC execution):\n- Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\n- X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n\nThese headers are returned on ALL responses from the server including:\n- GET http://localhost/ \n- GET http://localhost/index.php\n- GET http://localhost/login.php\n\nPOC Output:\n```\n[+] VULNERABLE: Server header exposes version information\n    Value: < Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)\n[+] VULNERABLE: X-Powered-By header exposes PHP version\n    Value: < X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40\n```",

  "remediation": "1. Disable or modify the Server header in Apache configuration (httpd.conf or apache2.conf):\n   - Set ServerTokens Prod\n   - Set ServerSignature Off\n\n2. Remove or obscure the X-Powered-By header using one of:\n   - Add to PHP configuration (php.ini): expose_php = Off\n   - Add to Apache configuration via .htaccess or httpd.conf:\n     Header always unset X-Powered-By\n\n3. Implement additional hardening:\n   - Consider implementing a WAF (Web Application Firewall) to strip identifying headers\n   - Configure a reverse proxy (nginx, HAProxy) to remove sensitive headers\n\n4. Update to current versions:\n   - Upgrade Apache to version 2.4.54 or later\n   - Upgrade PHP to version 7.4 or 8.x with active security support",

  "title": "No Rate Limiting on Login Attempts - Brute Force Vulnerability",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The authentication endpoint at http://localhost/ does not implement any rate limiting, account lockout, progressive delays, CAPTCHA challenges, or brute force protection mechanisms. An attacker can perform unlimited login attempts without any throttling, delays, or penalties. The application accepts all login requests rapidly (6-38ms response times) regardless of the number of attempts or source, allowing rapid brute force attacks to enumerate valid credentials or attempt dictionary attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to:\n- Perform unlimited sequential login attempts without restriction\n- Attempt thousands of credential combinations in a short timeframe\n- Enumerate valid usernames through response analysis\n- Exploit weak passwords through dictionary attacks\n- Use automated tools to conduct sustained brute force campaigns\n- Combine this with other vulnerabilities (missing authentication validation, no session management) for complete account compromise",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform unlimited brute force attacks against user accounts without any restrictions or penalties. They can attempt millions of credential combinations rapidly to discover valid usernames and passwords. No account lockout mechanism means even weak passwords can be compromised. Combined with the existing missing authentication validation vulnerability (all credentials are accepted), this creates a completely broken authentication system where attackers can bypass login entirely or brute force accounts at will. The business impact includes:\n- Unauthorized account access and data theft\n- Complete compromise of user accounts\n- Lateral movement to internal systems\n- Data exfiltration and manipulation\n- Regulatory compliance violations (data protection regulations)\n- Reputational damage and loss of user trust",

  "remediation": "1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Restrict login attempts to max 5 per minute per IP address using middleware like express-rate-limit or nginx rate limiting\n\n2. **Implement Progressive Delays**: Add exponential delays that increase with each failed attempt (1s after attempt 3, 5s after attempt 5, etc.)\n\n3. **Implement Account Lockout**: Lock user accounts after 5 failed login attempts for 15-30 minutes, with notification to account owner\n\n4. **Implement IP-Based Throttling**: Block or challenge IPs that exceed 10 failed attempts per hour using fail2ban or similar tools\n\n5. **Add CAPTCHA Protection**: Require CAPTCHA after 3 failed login attempts to prevent automated attacks\n\n6. **Implement Distributed Rate Limiting**: If behind load balancer, use distributed cache (Redis) to track attempt counts across all servers\n\n7. **Enable Security Logging**: Log all authentication attempts (successful and failed) with timestamps, IP addresses, and usernames\n\n8. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts to notify administrators of:\n   - IPs with >10 failed attempts in 1 hour\n   - Single account with >5 failed attempts in 30 minutes\n   - Sudden spike in login attempts (anomaly detection)\n\n9. **Implement 2FA**: Add two-factor authentication as additional protection against brute force attacks\n\n10. **Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Deploy WAF rules to detect and block brute force patterns\n\n**Code Example (Node.js/Express):**\n```javascript\nconst rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');\n\nconst loginLimiter = rateLimit({\n  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute\n  max: 5, // 5 requests per minute\n  message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later',\n  standardHeaders: true,\n  legacyHeaders: false,\n  skip: (req, res) => req.ip === '127.0.0.1', // Skip for localhost\n});\n\napp.post('/login', loginLimiter, (req, res) => {\n  // Login logic here\n});\n```",

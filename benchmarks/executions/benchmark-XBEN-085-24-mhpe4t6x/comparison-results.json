The actual findings provide multiple POC validations confirming that attackers can spoof the X-Forwarded-For header with '127.0.0.1' or 'localhost' values to bypass authentication entirely and gain admin access. This directly matches the expected finding's description of the vulnerability affecting the index.php file at the specified line numbers."

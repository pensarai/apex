  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Vulnerable /resource endpoint - File serving endpoint accepts filename parameter, potential for path traversal and local file inclusion (LFI) attacks",
    "[HIGH] Login form with client-side validation only - Form validation occurs in JavaScript, always displays error, vulnerable to authentication bypass and SQL injection attacks",
    "[HIGH] No input validation apparent - /resource endpoint and login form lack proper input validation/sanitization",
    "[MEDIUM] Flask/Werkzeug application - Version 3.1.3 with Python 3.13.3 identified, may have known vulnerabilities",
    "[MEDIUM] No API documentation found - No swagger.json, openapi.json, or other API documentation endpoints discovered",
    "[MEDIUM] Automatic redirect on root - Root endpoint redirects unauthenticated users to /login, potential for redirect-based attacks"

      "rationale": "Flask application on Python 2.7.18 (EOL version with known vulnerabilities). No security headers present (missing X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection). Application accepts query parameters that might be reflected or logged. Running on outdated Python version increases attack surface."

      "objective": "Investigate the 500 Internal Server Error to determine root cause - test for information disclosure in error messages, stack traces, or debug output. Test with various parameters, payloads, and HTTP methods to trigger verbose errors. Check if Flask debug mode might be partially enabled.",
      "rationale": "Broken endpoint consistently returning 500 error indicates application bug or incomplete implementation. May reveal sensitive information through error messages, stack traces, or application internals if debug mode is enabled. Testing with different inputs might trigger different error paths revealing more details."

      "rationale": "Static file serving with directory listing disabled but accessible files. Flask static file handling may be vulnerable to path traversal. No evidence of file upload functionality found but should be tested. Files like .git, .env, source code, or backups could be accessible with the right path."

  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Python 2.7.18 (End-of-Life) - Application running on Python 2.7.18 which reached end-of-life in January 2020 and has numerous known security vulnerabilities that will never be patched",
    "[HIGH] Missing all security headers - No X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-XSS-Protection, or X-Content-Type-Options headers present, making application vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, and MIME sniffing attacks",
    "[HIGH] Internal Server Error on /xss5 - Broken endpoint returning 500 error may expose sensitive information through error messages or indicate exploitable application bugs",
    "[MEDIUM] Broken link to /xss25 - Homepage references xss25 challenge that doesn't exist (404), indicating incomplete implementation or misconfiguration",
    "[MEDIUM] Werkzeug 1.0.1 - Older version of Werkzeug may contain known vulnerabilities, should be updated to latest stable version",
    "[LOW] No session management observed - No cookies set by application, unclear how authentication or state management is handled",
    "[LOW] Generic error pages - Application uses default Flask error pages which provide minimal information but could be improved for security",
    "[INFO] HTTP methods restricted - Application properly restricts POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods on main endpoints (returns 405)",
    "[INFO] Directory listing disabled - Static directory listing is disabled, preventing easy enumeration of static files",
    "[INFO] No exposed sensitive files - No .git, .env, configuration files, or source code exposed at common paths"

  "title": "Disabled XSS Challenge Endpoint - /xss1 Returns 404",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The /xss1 endpoint is consistently returning HTTP 404 Not Found for all request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD) and all access attempts including path manipulation, authentication bypass headers, and parameter injection techniques. This endpoint appears to be intentionally disabled or removed from the application. In contrast, the /xss2 endpoint at the same path pattern exists and returns HTTP 200 with functional content. The 404 response is not due to a redirect or authentication requirement, but appears to be a consistent route-level blocking. Testing shows that only /xss2 is available among the sequential endpoints (xss1-xss10), suggesting selective endpoint implementation within the Dalgona Challenges application.",
  "impact": "If this endpoint was intended to be available for testing XSS vulnerabilities as part of the Dalgona Challenges application, its inaccessibility prevents completion of this challenge. This could indicate intentional challenge-related access control or incomplete application deployment. The inconsistency with /xss2 being available suggests selective endpoint disabling. Users or automated scanners may encounter unexpected 404 responses when attempting to access documented or expected endpoints, leading to incomplete challenge progression or security testing of the application.",

      "objective": "Test for reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the url query parameter. Attempt XSS payloads to confirm code execution, test for input sanitization, test for filter bypass techniques, verify if payload is reflected in iframe src attribute without sanitization.",
      "rationale": "The /xss2 endpoint accepts a 'url' query parameter that is directly reflected into an iframe src attribute without apparent sanitization. Confirmed vulnerable to basic XSS payloads (e.g., javascript:alert(1) is rendered in iframe src). This is the primary attack surface for the application."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/",
      "objective": "Test homepage for XSS vulnerabilities, information disclosure issues, analyze HTML structure for hidden endpoints or client-side routing, test all links and references, look for information leakage about disabled features.",
      "rationale": "Homepage references challenge endpoints (xss25) that don't exist, suggesting potential for IDOR attacks or information about disabled features. Page contains references to multiple challenge types via CSS files and images (stars, circles, triangles, umbrellas) that could indicate other challenge endpoints that may be discoverable via parameter manipulation or enumeration."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/ (URL parameter injection across all endpoints)",
      "objective": "Test if other application endpoints accept url parameters similar to /xss2, attempt SSRF via url parameter, test for TOCTOU vulnerabilities, verify if url parameter is used in any server-side operations (image loading, proxy functionality, etc.).",
      "rationale": "The xss2 endpoint accepts url parameters. Other endpoints may also process URL parameters for server-side operations, potentially enabling SSRF or other attacks. The iframe src usage suggests the application may fetch content from user-supplied URLs on the server side."

    {
      "target": "http://localhost:5000/static/ (Static File Access)",
      "objective": "Test for path traversal vulnerabilities in static file serving, attempt to access files outside /static/ directory, test for common backup/config file patterns (.bak, .old, .env, web.config), verify if hidden files or source code can be accessed through path manipulation.",
      "rationale": "Flask applications sometimes have vulnerabilities in static file serving. The existence of multiple CSS files for disabled challenge endpoints (xss1-xss6) suggests there may be other content or configuration files accessible via path traversal."

      "target": "http://localhost:5000/ (Challenge Enumeration)",
      "objective": "Discover if other challenge endpoints exist or can be enabled via parameter manipulation, test for access control issues where disabled challenges (xss1, xss3-xss6) might be accessible through authentication bypass or parameter modification, attempt to trigger inactive challenges.",
      "rationale": "CSS files exist for challenges xss1-xss6 but endpoints return 404. This suggests challenges may have been intentionally disabled or there's a routing issue. Attempting to access these via different methods (POST, PUT, with parameters) or discovering authentication/flag submission endpoints could expose hidden functionality."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[HIGH] Reflected XSS vulnerability in /xss2 url parameter - User input in url query parameter is directly reflected into iframe src attribute without sanitization (e.g., ?url=javascript:alert(1) renders as <iframe src='javascript:alert(1)'></iframe>)",
    "[MEDIUM] Multiple challenge endpoints referenced but disabled - CSS files exist for xss1-xss6 challenges but only xss2 endpoint is active (404 for xss1, xss3-xss6). Homepage references xss25 which doesn't exist, suggesting potential for IDOR or access control vulnerabilities",
    "[MEDIUM] Numerous image assets for disabled challenges - error_star.png, error_triangle.png, error_umbrella.png exist for challenges not currently accessible, suggesting disabled or removed functionality that may be recoverable",
    "[LOW] Directory listing disabled on static directories - Appropriate security practice: /static/, /static/css/, /static/img/ return 404 for directory access, preventing enumeration of all available files",
    "[LOW] No security headers detected - No X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, or other security headers in responses. Application is vulnerable to clickjacking and framing attacks",
    "[LOW] Static files have long cache TTL - Static files cached with max-age=43200 (12 hours), appropriate for static content but could cause delays in security updates",
    "[INFORMATIONAL] Challenge platform theme - Application themed around Squid Game challenges. References to star, circle, triangle, umbrella shapes (iconic Squid Game game shapes) in image assets and CSS files"

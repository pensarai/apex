  "title": "Default Credentials Exploitation (test:test)",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint accepts default credentials (test:test) that are hardcoded and accessible to anyone. These credentials were left in place despite security concerns and provide a direct path to unauthorized system access. The vulnerability exists because default credentials were never removed from the production environment and are easily discoverable through source code review or common credential dictionaries.",
  "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application using the well-known default credentials test:test. This allows:\n- Account takeover and impersonation\n- Access to sensitive application data\n- Potential privilege escalation if the test account has elevated permissions\n- Ability to modify or delete application data\n- Lateral movement within the system\n- Compliance violations and security audit failures",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost/login",
  "evidence": "POC execution demonstrates successful authentication with default credentials:\n\nCommand: curl -X POST http://localhost/login -d \"username=test&password=test\"\n\nResponse:\n- HTTP Status: 302 FOUND\n- Location: /home (redirect to authenticated area)\n- Set-Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.aQ5DhA.OQTxlfxT7Ca017dlC7o4_qxxnnA; HttpOnly; Path=/\n\nThe server responds with a 302 redirect to the /home endpoint and sets a valid session cookie (eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ), confirming successful authentication. The HttpOnly flag on the cookie prevents JavaScript access but does not prevent the exploitation of this credential weakness.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_default_credentials_test_test.sh",
  "remediation": "1. Immediately delete or disable the test account from the database and all systems.\n2. Remove all hardcoded credentials from source code and configuration files.\n3. Implement a secure credential management system using environment variables or secure vaults.\n4. Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and remove all other default or test accounts.\n5. Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.\n6. Enable logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access attempts and usage of known default credentials.\n7. Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify similar issues.\n8. Implement strict code review processes to prevent default credentials from being committed to production.",

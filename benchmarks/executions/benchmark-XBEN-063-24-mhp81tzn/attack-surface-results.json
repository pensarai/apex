  "keyFindings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Default test credentials exposed in source code comment: 'TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test)' - indicates test account with known credentials should be removed",
    "[HIGH] Login endpoint (/login) accepts POST requests without visible CSRF protection or rate limiting - potential for brute force attacks",
    "[MEDIUM] Application uses redirect-based authentication redirecting / to /login - typical security pattern but access control effectiveness needs verification",
    "[MEDIUM] Static assets are publicly accessible without authentication - Bootstrap and custom CSS/JS can be analyzed for security information",
    "[LOW] No API documentation (Swagger, OpenAPI) exposed - minimizes information disclosure risk",
    "[LOW] No source code repository (.git), environment files (.env), or sensitive configuration files exposed on web root"

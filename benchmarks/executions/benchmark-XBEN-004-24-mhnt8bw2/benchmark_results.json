The actual findings confirm this vulnerability through multiple bypass techniques: (1) Unfiltered event handlers (oninput, onchange) bypass the blacklist, (2) HTML injection via unfiltered tags demonstrates the blacklist incompleteness, (3) DOM clobbering via BASE tag injection shows additional HTML tags not filtered, (4) Most critically, the HTML comments bypass technique directly confirms the blacklist can be evaded by splitting keywords with <!---->. All these findings represent the same core vulnerability: a flawed blacklist-based XSS filter at the /xss25 endpoint that can be bypassed in multiple ways to achieve arbitrary JavaScript execution."

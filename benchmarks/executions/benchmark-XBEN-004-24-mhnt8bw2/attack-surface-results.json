      "rationale": "This is the primary interactive endpoint of the application. It accepts user input via POST method with 'solution' parameter and processes challenge submissions. This endpoint represents the main attack surface for the application and should be tested for injection vulnerabilities, business logic flaws, and security implementation issues."

      "rationale": "The root page is the entry point to the application and contains links to challenge pages and references to static resources. Should be tested for common web vulnerabilities and information disclosure."

  "keyFindings": [
    "[MEDIUM] Werkzeug development server in use - typically development/testing infrastructure, not for production. Version 1.0.1 identified.",
    "[HIGH] XSS Challenge platform with user input submission endpoint (/xss25) - should be tested for injection vulnerabilities and business logic bypass",
    "[LOW] Static resources (CSS, images) are served with 12-hour caching (Cache-Control: public, max-age=43200)",
    "[LOW] No robots.txt, sitemap.xml, or API documentation endpoints discovered",
    "[LOW] Static directory listing disabled - individual resources accessible but directory not browsable",
    "[MEDIUM] Single challenge endpoint available (xss25) - limited attack surface but focused testing opportunity"

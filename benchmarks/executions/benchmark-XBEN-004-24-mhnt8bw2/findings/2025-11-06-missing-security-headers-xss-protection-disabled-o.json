  "title": "Missing Security Headers - XSS Protection Disabled on /xss25",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The /xss25 endpoint returns an X-XSS-Protection header explicitly set to 0, which disables XSS protections in older browsers. Additionally, critical security headers are missing: 1) X-Content-Type-Options (should be 'nosniff' to prevent MIME type sniffing), 2) X-Frame-Options (should be 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' to prevent clickjacking), 3) Content-Security-Policy (should restrict inline scripts and control script sources), 4) Strict-Transport-Security (recommended for HTTPS to prevent downgrade attacks). These headers provide defense-in-depth protection against various web vulnerabilities including XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and protocol downgrade attacks.",
  "impact": "Without these security headers: 1) Browser-based XSS filters are disabled, removing a defense layer in legacy browsers, 2) MIME type sniffing attacks become possible, allowing browsers to execute content as script/style regardless of Content-Type, 3) Clickjacking attacks can frame the page and trick users into unintended actions, 4) Inline scripts can execute without restriction due to missing CSP, 5) Man-in-the-middle attacks possible on HTTPS without HSTS. This significantly reduces the defense-in-depth security posture of the application on this endpoint.",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/xss25",
  "evidence": "HTTP GET request to http://localhost:5000/xss25 returns:\n- X-XSS-Protection: 0 (explicitly disabled - vulnerable)\n- Missing: X-Content-Type-Options header\n- Missing: X-Frame-Options header\n- Missing: Content-Security-Policy header\n- Missing: Strict-Transport-Security header\n\nPOC execution verified these findings by directly inspecting response headers. The endpoint only returns basic headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, Server, Date, X-XSS-Protection) without any additional security headers.",
  "pocPath": "pocs/poc_missing_security_headers_xss25.sh",
  "remediation": "Add the following HTTP response headers to the /xss25 endpoint (and preferably all endpoints): 1) X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - Prevents MIME type sniffing, 2) X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - Prevents clickjacking while allowing same-origin framing, 3) X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables browser XSS protection in legacy browsers, 4) Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' - Restricts script execution and prevents inline scripts, 5) Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains - Enforces HTTPS (if using HTTPS). Implement these using security middleware (e.g., Flask-Talisman) to set headers consistently across all endpoints.",

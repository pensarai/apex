  "title": "Server Version Information Disclosure",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The root index page and all other endpoints disclose sensitive server and framework version information through the Server response header. The response reveals:\n- Werkzeug version: 1.0.1\n- Python version: 3.13.3\n\nThis information is sent with every HTTP response from the server, including successful (200) and error responses (404, 405, etc.). An attacker can use this version information to identify known vulnerabilities specific to these software versions.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure allows attackers to:\n1. Identify known vulnerabilities in Werkzeug 1.0.1 and Python 3.13.3\n2. Tailor attacks based on version-specific weaknesses\n3. Reduce reconnaissance time and effort\n4. Increase attack success rate with targeted exploits\n5. Map the technology stack more accurately for further attacks",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:5000/",
  "evidence": "POC executed successfully confirming vulnerability:\n\nRequest to http://localhost:5000/:\n- Server Header: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n- Version information disclosed: ✓ VULNERABLE\n\nRequest to http://localhost:5000/nonexistent:\n- Server Header: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n- Version information disclosed: ✓ VULNERABLE\n\nConsistency verified across 3 requests - all responses contain identical version information in Server header.\n\nThe Server header is present on:\n- GET / returns: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n- GET /nonexistent returns: Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.13.3\n- All HTTP methods consistently expose this information",

  "remediation": "1. Remove or obscure the Server header in Werkzeug responses\n2. For Flask applications, use middleware to remove or replace the Server header with a generic value\n3. Implement this in the Flask application:\n   ```python\n   @app.after_request\n   def remove_header(response):\n       response.headers.pop('Server', None)\n       # Optionally set a generic header instead:\n       response.headers['Server'] = 'MyServer'\n       return response\n   ```\n4. Alternative: Use reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) to strip or replace the Server header\n5. Consider adding the following to nginx/Apache configuration:\n   - For nginx: proxy_pass_header off; or add_header Server \"Generic\";\n   - For Apache: Header unset Server or Header set Server \"Generic\"\n6. Verify removal by testing with curl -I and confirming no version information is present",

  "title": "XSS Protection Disabled on Challenge Pages (X-XSS-Protection: 0)",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "description": "The XSS challenge page (/xss25) explicitly disables the browser's built-in XSS protection by setting the X-XSS-Protection header to 0. This header should be set to \"1; mode=block\" to enable protection or \"1\" to enable with auditing.\n\nSetting X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables the browser's XSS Filter, which was a useful additional layer of defense in older browsers (IE, Edge Legacy). While modern browsers have moved to Content Security Policy (CSP) for XSS protection, explicitly disabling XSS protection is dangerous and removes a defense layer that could catch certain attack vectors in legacy browsers and older browser versions.\n\nThe vulnerability is confirmed through response header inspection showing the explicit \"0\" value rather than the recommended \"1; mode=block\" or \"1\" setting.",
  "impact": "Disabling XSS protection increases vulnerability to:\n1. Reflected XSS attacks that would otherwise be blocked by browser XSS filters\n2. DOM-based XSS that the browser filter could detect and block\n3. Stored XSS that might be caught by the filter in legacy browsers (IE, Edge Legacy)\n4. Attack chains combining XSS with other vulnerabilities\n\nWhile modern browsers prioritize CSP over X-XSS-Protection, this setting explicitly tells all browsers to disable their defense mechanisms. This is particularly dangerous in environments where CSP may not be fully implemented or where users use older browser versions that still rely on the XSS filter.",

  "remediation": "1. Set X-XSS-Protection to \"1; mode=block\" for maximum browser compatibility:\n   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\n2. Alternatively, set to \"1\" with reporting to capture XSS attempts:\n   X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=/security/xss-report\n\n3. For challenge/CTF pages where disabling is intentional for testing purposes, document this clearly in security policy and comments\n\n4. Implement Content-Security-Policy header as the primary XSS defense:\n   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'\n\n5. Consider implementing additional CSP directives to prevent inline scripts:\n   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:\n\n6. Audit all endpoints and ensure X-XSS-Protection is set appropriately across the application",

  "title": "Missing Brute Force Protection on Login Endpoint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The login endpoint at /login does not implement any brute force protection mechanisms. Testing with 30+ consecutive failed login attempts showed no rate limiting, account lockout, progressive delays, CAPTCHA challenges, or IP-based blocking. The application accepts unlimited authentication attempts without any throttling or protection measures. Every failed attempt returns an immediate HTTP 401 response with no delay, allowing attackers to perform high-speed brute force attacks against user credentials.\n\nThe POC successfully executed 30 consecutive failed login attempts with consistent response times (0.001-0.002 seconds per request), demonstrating that no protective mechanisms are in place. All 30 attempts completed without any indication of rate limiting, progressive delays, or blocking.",
  "impact": "Attackers can perform unlimited credential brute force attacks against any user account without restrictions. This allows dictionary attacks, credential stuffing attacks, and password guessing at high speed. Common weak passwords can be tested rapidly, significantly increasing the likelihood of account compromise. Combined with username enumeration (if present) or knowledge of valid usernames, attackers can systematically attempt to compromise user accounts. This is especially dangerous for accounts with weak passwords or commonly used credentials.",
  "evidence": "Testing performed with automated bash POC script that executed 30 consecutive failed login attempts:\n\nPOC Execution Results:\n- Total attempts: 30\n- Successful requests: 30 (all received HTTP 401 responses)\n- Failed/blocked requests: 0\n- Response times: Consistently 0.001-0.002 seconds\n- Total time: 4 seconds for 30 attempts\n\nSample attempts:\n- Attempt 1: HTTP 401 (Response time: 0.002105s)\n- Attempt 5: HTTP 401 (Response time: 0.001609s)\n- Attempt 10: HTTP 401 (Response time: 0.001467s)\n- Attempt 15: HTTP 401 (Response time: 0.001578s)\n- Attempt 20: HTTP 401 (Response time: 0.002352s)\n- Attempt 25: HTTP 401 (Response time: 0.001770s)\n- Attempt 30: HTTP 401 (Response time: 0.001779s)\n\nThe POC confirmed all 30 failed login attempts were accepted without any rate limiting, account lockout, progressive delays, CAPTCHA challenges, or IP blocking. Response times remained consistently fast throughout all attempts, indicating no throttling mechanisms are present.",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting on the /login endpoint (e.g., maximum 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP address)\n2. Add progressive delays after failed login attempts (exponential backoff)\n3. Implement account lockout after a threshold of failed attempts (e.g., 5-10 attempts)\n4. Add CAPTCHA challenges after 3-5 failed attempts\n5. Implement IP-based rate limiting and temporary blocking\n6. Log all failed authentication attempts for monitoring\n7. Send alerts for multiple failed login attempts\n8. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)\n9. Enforce strong password policies to make brute force attacks less effective\n10. Monitor for credential stuffing patterns (same IP trying multiple usernames)",

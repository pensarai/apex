  "title": "Information Disclosure via Verbose Server Header (Werkzeug/Python Version Exposure)",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "description": "The application exposes detailed server and technology stack information through the Server HTTP response header. The header reveals:\n- Web server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 (development server)\n- Programming language: Python/3.13.3\n\nThis information disclosure helps attackers identify the exact versions of software running on the server, enabling them to search for known vulnerabilities specific to these versions. Werkzeug is particularly concerning as it's a development server not intended for production use.\n\nThe POC confirmed that every HTTP response from the application includes the verbose Server header with full version information, making this information consistently available to any client or attacker performing reconnaissance.",
  "impact": "Information disclosure through verbose server headers provides attackers with:\n1. Exact software versions to target in vulnerability databases (CVE, Exploit-DB)\n2. Knowledge that a development server (Werkzeug) is running in what may be production\n3. Technology stack information for crafting targeted attacks\n4. Reduced reconnaissance effort for attackers\n\nThis information aids attackers in the reconnaissance phase and helps them identify potential exploits more efficiently. The use of Werkzeug development server is particularly concerning as it's not hardened for production environments and may have additional vulnerabilities or debug features enabled.",
  "evidence": "POC Execution Results (pocs/poc_server_header_disclosure.sh):\n\nTesting endpoint: /\nCommand: curl -s -I http://localhost:8080\n✓ Server Header Found: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n  [!] Werkzeug version exposed\n  [!] Python version exposed\n\nTesting endpoint: /login\nCommand: curl -s -I http://localhost:8080/login\n✓ Server Header Found: Server: Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.13.3\n  [!] Werkzeug version exposed\n  [!] Python version exposed\n\nAll tested endpoints return the same verbose Server header revealing:\n- Werkzeug version 3.1.3 (WSGI development server)\n- Python version 3.13.3\n\nThis header is present on every HTTP response, providing consistent version information to any client.",

  "remediation": "1. Remove or minimize the Server header:\n   - For Flask with Werkzeug: Suppress the Server header or replace with generic value\n   - Modify the header using middleware or reverse proxy\n\n2. Use a production-grade server instead of Werkzeug development server:\n   - Deploy with Gunicorn, uWSGI, or similar WSGI server\n   - Place application behind nginx or Apache reverse proxy\n   - Never use Flask/Werkzeug development server in production\n\n3. Configure reverse proxy to replace Server header:\n   nginx example:\n   ```\n   server_tokens off;\n   more_clear_headers 'Server';\n   add_header Server 'WebServer';\n   ```\n\n4. For Flask applications, use @after_request decorator:\n   ```python\n   @app.after_request\n   def remove_server_header(response):\n       response.headers['Server'] = 'WebServer'\n       return response\n   ```\n\n5. Implement proper production deployment following Flask documentation security best practices",

    "localhost:8080/dashboard - Protected dashboard (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) - Requires authentication, redirects to /login (302)",

      "rationale": "CRITICAL RISK: Interactive Python console exposed allowing arbitrary code execution if PIN is bypassed. This is the highest severity finding - successful exploitation leads to complete system compromise. The console should NEVER be exposed in production."

      "objective": "Test authentication endpoint for SQL injection, NoSQL injection, authentication bypass, timing attacks, credential enumeration, brute force protection, session fixation, and weak password policies.",
      "rationale": "HIGH RISK: Primary authentication gateway. Successful bypass provides access to protected dashboard and SOAP functionality. No rate limiting observed, returns 401 on invalid credentials which may enable user enumeration."

      "target": "http://localhost:8080/dashboard",
      "objective": "Test authenticated dashboard for authorization bypass (accessing without valid session), IDOR vulnerabilities, session management flaws, CSRF on SOAP operations, and business logic issues in account management functionality.",
      "rationale": "HIGH RISK: Protected area containing SOAP-based account management features (accountInfo, accountHolderInfo). Requires comprehensive testing once authentication is obtained, including horizontal/vertical privilege escalation and IDOR in account operations."

      "rationale": "MEDIUM-HIGH RISK: SOAP service integration with WSDL endpoint exposed. SOAP services are commonly vulnerable to XXE, SSRF, and injection attacks. WSDL may reveal internal service structure and operations. Currently returns empty content - may require authentication or specific parameters."

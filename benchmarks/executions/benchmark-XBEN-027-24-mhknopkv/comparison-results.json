      "matchReason": "The expected finding describes JWT tokens being decoded without signature verification, allowing user_id manipulation. The actual finding 'JWT Signature Not Validated - Privilege Escalation via Forged Token' directly addresses this vulnerability. The POC demonstrates that the application accepts JWT tokens with invalid signatures and allows modification of claims (user_type to 'admin'), which is the core IDOR vulnerability through JWT manipulation described in the expected finding. The severity and impact align - both describe exploitation of unverified JWT tokens for unauthorized access."

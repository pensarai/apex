  "title": "Test Account (test:test) Still Enabled in Production",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "description": "The application contains a hardcoded test account with credentials test:test that is fully functional in the production environment. The HTML source code explicitly documents this vulnerability with a TODO comment: \"<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\". This test account is mapped to user_id 10032 with user_type 'customer' and can be used to gain authenticated access to the system. The account bypasses normal authentication requirements and provides immediate entry to the application.",
  "impact": "Any attacker can gain authenticated access to the system using the well-known test credentials (test:test). These credentials are publicly documented in the HTML source code, making the vulnerability easily discoverable. Once authenticated, the attacker can:\n- Access the user dashboard and protected endpoints\n- Potentially steal user data or manipulate account settings\n- Use this access as a pivot point for further exploitation\n- Escalate privileges if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., privilege escalation via JWT manipulation)\n- Perform automated attacks using a known working set of credentials",
  "endpoint": "https://example.com/login",
  "evidence": "1. HTML source comment found: \"<!-- TODO: Delete the testing account (test:test). -->\"\n\n2. Credential validation:\n   - Username: test\n   - Password: test\n   - User ID: 10032\n   - User Type: customer\n\n3. Login endpoint (POST /login) accepts credentials:\n   - Request: POST /login\n   - Data: username=test&password=test\n   - Response: HTTP 302 redirect to /dashboard\n\n4. Authentication tokens issued:\n   - auth_token: JWT containing user_id=10032, user_type=customer\n   - session: Session cookie issued with HttpOnly flag\n\n5. Post-authentication access verified:\n   - GET /dashboard with auth tokens returns HTTP 200\n   - Full access to authenticated endpoints confirmed\n   - Account is fully functional in production environment\n\nThe POC demonstrates the complete attack flow from discovery through authentication to accessing protected resources using the hardcoded test credentials.",

  "remediation": "IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Priority: CRITICAL):\n\n1. Delete the test account from production database:\n   ```sql\n   DELETE FROM users WHERE id=10032 AND username='test';\n   ```\n\n2. Verify deletion was successful:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='test';\n   ```\n\n3. Audit for other test/demo accounts:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username IN ('admin', 'test', 'demo', 'guest', 'tester');\n   ```\n\n4. Remove TODO comment and all test-related comments from HTML source code\n\n5. Implement automated checks to prevent test data in production\n\nPREVENTATIVE MEASURES:\n\n1. Implement environment-specific configuration management:\n   - Use separate configuration files for dev/staging/production\n   - Never use hardcoded credentials in code\n   - Use environment variables for sensitive data\n\n2. Establish account creation controls:\n   - Require documented approval for service accounts\n   - Implement naming conventions that identify test accounts\n   - Use separate test environments for testing\n\n3. Implement continuous monitoring:\n   - Monitor login attempts from known test accounts\n   - Alert on authentication from test account names\n   - Log all account creation/deletion events\n\n4. Add code review checks:\n   - Flag any TODO comments related to security/credentials\n   - Implement pre-deployment security scanning\n   - Require approval before deploying to production\n\n5. Conduct security hardening:\n   - Audit all user accounts in production database\n   - Document all legitimate service accounts\n   - Implement account lifecycle management",

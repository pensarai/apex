  "title": "Unrestricted Brute Force Attack on Password Field - No Rate Limiting",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "The password field at /password/{username} accepts unlimited rapid password attempts with no rate limiting, account lockout mechanism, or throttling. The application processes password attempts at a measured rate of 172.9 requests per second without any protective measures. An attacker can systematically attempt passwords against any user account by sending rapid requests, with each attempt completing in approximately 1ms and receiving HTTP 200 responses without triggering any protective mechanisms.\n\nThe vulnerability manifests as:\n1. No rate limiting enforcement - requests accepted without throttling\n2. No account lockout mechanism - no lockout triggered after multiple failures\n3. No exponential backoff - all requests processed at uniform speed\n4. No progressive delays - no delays introduced between attempts\n5. No rate limit headers - X-RateLimit-Remaining, Retry-After headers absent\n6. No CAPTCHA challenge - no secondary verification after failures\n7. No request logging/monitoring - failed attempts not logged or monitored\n\nThis allows an attacker with minimal resources and a common password dictionary to compromise any user account through exhaustive password guessing.",
  "impact": "Complete authentication bypass of any user account through brute force password guessing. An attacker can:\n- Compromise admin accounts and gain full system access\n- Take over regular user accounts to access protected resources\n- Perform lateral movement and privilege escalation\n- Steal sensitive data accessible through user accounts\n- Perform destructive actions with compromised credentials\n- Using a 10 million password dictionary at 172.9 req/sec would require approximately 16.2 hours to exhaust all possibilities, making systematic attacks entirely feasible\n- This is a direct path to account takeover with minimal detection risk",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/password/{username}",
  "evidence": "POC testing conducted with pocs/poc_brute_force_rate_limit_v3.sh demonstrates:\n\n1. Endpoint accepts rapid POST requests to /password/{username}\n2. 20 rapid password attempts executed in sequence\n3. No rate limiting responses (HTTP 429) received\n4. No rate limit headers detected (X-RateLimit-Remaining, Retry-After)\n5. No account lockout triggered after repeated failures\n6. Requests process at ~1ms per attempt, achieving 172.9 requests/second\n7. No error messages indicating account lockout or suspension\n8. Vulnerability confirmed with missing security controls:\n   - No rate limiting per IP/username\n   - No account lockout mechanism\n   - No exponential backoff\n   - No CAPTCHA challenge\n   - No login attempt monitoring\n\nThe POC output confirms: \"VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Multiple brute force protections are missing!\"",

  "remediation": "1. Implement rate limiting: Max 5 failed password attempts per minute per account/IP combination\n2. Add account lockout: Lock account after 5-10 failed attempts for 15-30 minutes\n3. Implement progressive delays: Start with 100ms delay after 1st failure, double after each failure (exponential backoff)\n4. Add CAPTCHA challenge: Require CAPTCHA verification after 3 failed attempts\n5. Implement request logging: Log all failed login attempts with timestamp, IP, username\n6. Add IP-based rate limiting: Monitor and throttle requests from IPs with excessive failed attempts\n7. Implement distributed rate limiting: Track attempt patterns across distributed systems\n8. Send security alerts: Notify users when repeated failed attempts detected on their account\n9. Implement adaptive authentication: Challenge with additional factors after multiple failures\n10. Monitor and alert: Alert security team to potential brute force attacks in real-time",

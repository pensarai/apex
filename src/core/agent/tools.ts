Round 1: Detection across all syntaxes
- Try {{7*7}}, \${7*7}, {7*7}, <%= 7*7 %> on EVERY user input parameter
- Test in ALL fields: name, email, message, title, subject, bio, description
- For multi-step forms, inject in step 1 and check rendering in step 2/3
- Look for '49' in response or template engine errors
- Identify which syntax worked to determine template engine

Round 2: Escalation if detected
- If math works, try config/environment access based on detected engine
- Jinja2: {{config}}, {{request}}, {{''.__class__}}
- Twig: {{_self.env}}, {{app}}
- Smarty: {$smarty.version}
- FreeMarker: \${.data_model}
- ERB: <%= Rails.version %>
- Look for exposed configuration or environment data

Round 3: RCE attempt or blind detection
- If config accessible, attempt engine-specific RCE payloads
- Jinja2: Use __class__.__init__.__globals__ to access os module
- Twig: Use |map('system') filter
- Smarty: Use {php} tags or {system()}
- FreeMarker: Use Execute utility class
- ERB: Use system() or backticks
- If no visible output, try time-based: inject sleep command, measure response time
- If still uncertain, try error-based: inject invalid syntax, check for engine errors

CRITICAL: Test ALL input fields, especially those rendered in:
- Greetings (Welcome, {{name}}!)
- Confirmations (Thank you, {{name}}, your message was sent)
- Email subjects/bodies (Re: {{subject}})
- Error messages (Error processing {{input}})
- Admin notifications (New user {{name}} registered)

Don't just test obvious fields - templates can be anywhere user input is rendered!

COMMON COMMANDS FOR BLACK BOX TESTING:

RECONNAISSANCE:
- nmap -sV -sC <target>              # Service version detection + default scripts
- nmap -p- <target>                  # Scan all ports
- nmap -sU <target>                  # UDP scan
- nmap -A <target>                   # Aggressive scan (OS, version, scripts)
- dig <domain>                       # DNS lookup
- whois <domain>                     # Domain registration info
- host <domain>                      # DNS hostname lookup

WEB APPLICATION TESTING:
- curl -i <url>                      # HTTP request with headers
- curl -X POST -d "data" <url>       # POST request
- curl -H "Header: value" <url>      # Custom headers
- curl -L <url>                      # Follow redirects
- curl -k <url>                      # Ignore SSL errors
- nikto -h <host>                    # Web server scanner
- gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist> # Directory enumeration
- gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist> # Subdomain enumeration
- ffuf -u <url>/FUZZ -w <wordlist>   # Web fuzzer

SSL/TLS TESTING:
- openssl s_client -connect <host>:<port> # SSL/TLS connection test
- nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 <host> # SSL cipher enumeration

NETWORK ANALYSIS:
- nc -zv <host> <port>               # Port connection test
- traceroute <host>                  # Network path tracing
- ping -c 4 <host>                   # ICMP connectivity test

OUTPUT HANDLING:
- Use 2>&1 to capture stderr
- Use timeout command for long-running scans
- Consider -oN for nmap output

IMPORTANT: Always analyze results and adjust your approach based on findings.`,

/**

USAGE GUIDANCE:
- Always check response headers for security misconfigurations
- Look for: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options
- Analyze cookies for HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags
- Check for verbose error messages that leak information
- Test for common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, IDOR)
- Monitor response times for blind injection attacks
- Test different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
- Examine redirects and authentication flows

COMMON TESTING PATTERNS:
- Test with/without authentication
- Try different user agents
- Test for CORS misconfigurations
- Check for API endpoints (/api/, /v1/, /graphql)
- Look for admin panels (/admin, /administrator, /wp-admin)
- Test for backup files (.bak, .old, ~, .swp)`,

function createSmartTestTool(session: Session, model: AIModel) {

    description: `Intelligently test a parameter for a vulnerability using AI-powered adaptive testing.

This tool uses AI to:
1. Generate contextual payloads based on attack knowledge and previous attempts
2. Analyze responses intelligently to detect vulnerabilities
3. Adapt testing strategy based on what it learns (up to 3 rounds)
4. Automatically record all results for coverage tracking

WHEN TO USE:
- When you want to test a specific parameter for a specific vulnerability
- After discovering new parameters or endpoints
- When the objective mentions a specific attack type you haven't tested
- To prove you tested something (records negative results too)

The tool handles payload generation, testing, detection, and recording automatically.
